{"text": " Okay, it's working. Today is June 27, 2017. This is Alex Cline. I'm interviewing Shinzen Young at this beautiful home in Pacific Palisades where he's temporarily ensconced during a teaching trip here. This is session number two. Good morning. Good morning. We're continuing where we left off yesterday, which ended with your very interesting and to me surprising story of how you wound up in the Buddhist studies graduate program at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. And then we're going to follow the development into the 60s and all of that implies today, and hopefully see how far we get coming back to the LA area and the beginning of your teaching and studying. But I wanted to just ask one follow up question regarding your connection with the Japanese American community here when you were in junior high and high school, which was, I was wondering if through your friendship with your friend Jerry, or just through your own curiosity, if you ever wound up at any of the local Jodo Shinshu Buddhist temples, which were then called churches, I think. For example, the one in West LA on Corinth Avenue, just off the Sawtelle area. Yeah, you know, I could be wrong about this, but I think that the abbot or whatever they called it in their attempt to Americanize things, the head, the minister, I'm pretty sure he was one of my teachers at the Sawtelle Japanese Language Institute. That's a Pure Land temple that's near the Sawtelle. Yeah, exactly. It's a block off Sawtelle. Yeah, pretty sure that the minister there was one of my favorite teachers. I don't remember the name, but I remember thinking, wow, this is really cool. I actually know a Buddhist monk. I mean, you know, because I'm at this point 15, 16 years old. There was a pretty good cool factor there when we'd go by this temple. So I had that much, but nothing more. So you didn't go to Obon or anything like that? I used to go to the holidays, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, definitely. That was a lot of fun, because I was into the culture. I'd always go for, I think they used to call it Nisei week, which I think corresponded to Obon. Ah, okay. In the summer then. Yeah. I used to always go to that kind of stuff. I actually, when I was a kid, we would sometimes go to Obon at that temple as well. Yeah. Yeah, it might have been that very temple. I seem to vaguely remember Shinku, two kanji, Shinku Shonin. Was this Jodo Shinshu? Yeah, it would have been, yeah. I think that was Shinran's official name, and I seem to have remembered that on the altar, but this is, I could be wrong. But I didn't mention that in Japanese school, I remember I had had that fascination with martial arts. So Japanese school had martial arts clubs, not karate though, but two that I can remember are Judo and Kendo. So I joined the Judo club, but they were too big for me, the people, even though they say Judo's all about skill and whatever, size and strength matters. I couldn't really compete very well in the Judo club, so I switched to something where it wasn't so much about size and strength, I switched to the Kendo club, and I stayed with that for my whole time in Japanese school. I used to go to competitions all over the place, and it was just, again, an amazing cultural adventure. Like I say, it's like this fantasy that non-Asians may have about being thoroughly accepted, and you're the only one. Well, now I'm doing samurai stuff. And at the Oboon festivals, my senseis would give demonstrations. You may know what Iai is. Iai is not Kendo. Kendo is actually full-on contact with protection. Iai is live sword. It's rapid drawing and then kata forms. But it's live sword and it's done very quickly, and it's really scary because it's a mock combat. Yes, they know what the moves are going to be, right? But still, they go full speed and they just stop a millimeter before they split the guy's head wide open. They do it with a sharp blade because if they had a dull blade, they'd start to get careless. So it's a real danger art. They used to do it in Asahi. It was like, oh shit, because it's really fast, and then he just stops. You're mentioning Oboon. I can remember now, I think, at that temple, seeing my senseis just being amazed that they're doing this. It's just another world. I had an interesting experience a couple years ago, or a number of years ago. One of my students was driving with me in the car in that area, and I said, would you like to see my Japanese school? I hadn't seen it. I didn't even know if it was still there. I hadn't been back for decades. So we sort of searched around, and sure enough, it was still there. It was open, it was after regular school time, but that's when the club activities took place. There were things, they did Shigin. Shigin is Japanese, it's Sino-Japanese poetry chanted. It's a very intellectual thing, a very old-fashioned thing. Kuni-abure-te, sanga-ari, that kind of thing. They had that, and then flower arranging, of course, etc. So anyway, we get there, and it's after, so these different club activities are going on, and sure enough, the Kendo club is still there. So I went in, and I said, decades ago, I was in this club. They said, okay, you're going to want to see this. They took me into this room, and it was very emotional for me. So you know, there's, I mean, anthropologists call it ancestor worship or whatever. There's a thing, after people die, they either have photographs, or they have, called ihai, which are like little tablets that represent the dead ancestors. So what they had done is, they had photographs of all of the senseis that had been teachers there, going all the way back to the beginning. I saw the faces of these people that were my mentors into another world, when I was very impressionable and young, and I hadn't seen it, and it was like a quasi-memorial kind of set up. And I'm looking at them, and I'm thinking, because they're very much in character, right? So I mean, my God, I was raised by fucking samurai. And I just started to cry, and I just bowed and whatever, because it's like, what a privilege for this kid, who belonged to the race that was the enemy at one time, to sort of be, you know, and they were my role models, and that I was able to be in another world for real. And, wow, anyway. So we had six dan, roku dan, which is pretty high, right? It's a six degree black belt. And then we had, Mori sensei would come occasionally, kyudan, he was a ninth degree black belt. Ninth degree black belt belongs to another dimension completely from a sixth degree black belt. He wouldn't come very often, but he was an Olympic competitor. He was on the US kendo team in the Olympics the year they had it in Japan, so they had Japanese sports. So I actually got to a sword fight with an Olympic level kendo master. And it was amazing. It was not human. It was a machine. It was a machine that was invulnerable. And when he'd go, when he would compete with our usual main guy, who was the sixth degree black belt, he would actually just throw him around like a toy. So that was really something. Anyway, sorry I got off the riff. This is the kind of detail we love to hear. So we left off last time with this opportunity that you seized to go into this graduate program, which was being financed, I gather, by the Department of Defense. Ultimately, I'm pretty sure it was DOD money. They were called National Defense Fellowships. And it was three years. Three years they paid for my graduate education at the University of Wisconsin. And so how much of the source of this that you just now described did you know going into it? Were you aware of what the source of funding was for this program? Sure. Yeah, I knew it was Department of Defense. But there were no strings attached. They didn't expect me to be, you know, and to do anything. I think sometimes they do give you a scholarship and expect something, but not with this. They just wanted people born in this country to know something about Buddhism. So what did you know at that point really about Buddhism, particularly in relation to what they were interested in, which was what was happening in Vietnam? They never required that I in any way do anything directly related to that. It was completely hands-off. It wasn't like, okay, we're going to give you this money and we expect you to help us with our situation in Vietnam. It was nothing. It was no strings attached. So what I knew about Buddhism was quite a bit actually, because I knew it. You had that experience in Japan. Well, I did that and that's right. I'd actually done original research on a Buddhist school that no one had looked into, even in Japan very much. So I knew a lot academically. I knew nothing experientially. So what exactly did the program then entail or demand of you? I had to learn some new languages that were not East Asian languages, which is what I was used to. I had to learn Sanskrit. That was a little difficult initially because it's Sanskrit, although once again, I'd had some background, but not at the level that they were demanding. They were demanding that I actually learn the whole grammar of the language, not just a few principles of morphology and so forth. So it was, I want to get a sense of what the grammar of Sanskrit is like. Think of Greek on steroids. So highly inflected, a lot of complexity. I mean, in Greek you have singular and plural, but in Sanskrit you have singular, plural and dual. It's like everything's more complicated. So that was a little hard, but then I got into it. And then Pali, which is phonologically and grammatically simplified Sanskrit, so you learn Sanskrit first. I had to learn some Tibetan. So it extended my language repertoire quite a bit. I had already had a familiarity with Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean. So East Asian languages were mostly my thing. So I had to extend into Indo-European with the Sanskrit and the Pali, and then Tibetan a little bit. And then we read Buddhist texts. It was very text-oriented reading in the original languages. So I did a lot of that. And you indicated yesterday that this was also now with the advent of the 60s and changes happening at what would have been happening rapidly and in some ways drastically in terms of the national and world culture at the time. First, before we explore that a little bit more, who were some of the other students in the program? What kind of people were they? Well, that's what's so great, because I eventually dropped out of the academic program. I completed all my coursework. I completed my preliminary PhD exam. So all that was left was to write the thesis. But for several reasons, which we can go into, I never wrote that thesis. And I essentially took a leave of absence from the department and never went back to academic Buddhist studies. But I got all the goodies. I am as well trained as any professor of Buddhist studies anywhere. I just didn't write a PhD thesis. Who was there are the people that are now just retiring as the senior professors of Buddhist studies all over creation. We were crazy hippie kids. Not all of them were hippies, but a lot of us were pretty counterculture. But most of them did pursue academic careers and held positions, and they're now just retiring as respected senior Buddhist scholars. So basically, most of the people, not most, but a lot of the people that are known names in academic Buddhist studies would have been from that group. Like\u2014I'm blocking\u2014there's a bunch. Well, one name that comes to mind is Harvey Aronson, but there were a lot of others. Jeff Hopkins, he helped me a lot, sort of explained a lot of stuff to me about how Buddhism really works. So I would say people that are now prominent academics, most of us. One guy lost his marbles and I think ended up incarcerated in Switzerland or something. Stefan Aniker, he was a good friend of mine. Willard Johnson became a respected professor here, I think at maybe UCSD, I'm not sure, or down the coast somewhere. I'm trying to think of some of the other ones. Well, you know what? Someone wrote a book. These books about Buddhism, someone wrote a book that had all of us in it. Lopez maybe? Donald Lopez, maybe, I'm not sure. I remember seeing a book on the history of Buddhism and there was a section that were basically the whole Wisconsin crew were mentioned. So anyway, that's the\u2014so many of them became successful academics. I know you were sometimes unsure about years, so what years were we looking at here? I was pretty sure I went there in the late 60s. The late 60s. Because the one date that I'm confident of was I was ordained as a Shingon monk in 1970. Right. And that would have been after two years at the University of Wisconsin. Ah, okay. So you were there definitely at the height of 60s counterculture. Absolutely the height, yeah. We're sitting here today looking at the summer of love being 50 years ago, which is pretty freaky. What year was that? 67. So 67, that's right. Was that the summer of love, 67? Well, I spent both of my summer vacations with an old friend of mine in the Haight being introduced to the drug culture. Wow. At its absolute peak, yes. Yeah, yeah. In the Haight-Ashbury. That's where he was living. I was there. I was definitely there. Head shops everywhere, stoned all day, every day on something. That's just what he did. And we could probably do a whole interview just on that, but how would you say that changed or influenced you and your life direction and, dare I say, consciousness at the time? Well- Particularly in relation to your studies, if there is any relation. That's right. Well, actually, there was a moment. There was a moment, and I can probably date it, with the tag of the Beatles movie, The Yellow Submarine. One of my favorites. When did that come out? That was maybe 68 or 69. I can't remember. So I remember we dropped acid and we went to see The Yellow Submarine, meaning me and my friend who, we'd been in Japan together on the study abroad program. He's the person that introduced me to the world of getting turned on. So we saw The Yellow Submarine and then I was alone in the house, in the hay. I'm pretty sure it was in the hay. And they were away doing something. I was just alone. So what we used to do is, the day after an acid trip, if you get stoned on grass, you can get a little bit of the psychedelic buzz sometimes. So I was alone, I smoked. I describe this, by the way, in my book. Some of the material that we're having recorded here is in the first chapter of the Science of Enlightenment book, but it would probably be interesting to hear it from the IpsiDixit, the words of the person themselves. So I was alone and I got really stoned. And I was so stoned that I was hallucinating, even though I'm pretty sure it was hashish. I remember looking at my palm and there was a little man dancing on my palm, like a leprechaun. He didn't look like an Irish leprechaun, but he looked like a tap dancer. And it was a pretty vivid hallucination. It wasn't just visual and auditory. I could feel his little feet. It was all modalities. So I must have been, in retrospect, I must have been in a pretty deep state, right? Because as you know, that's what they call makyo in Zen when you get those intense visual hallucinations. And the Zen masters are both happy and concerned if a person has that happen. They're happy because it's a sign you're dropping deep. They're concerned because you might believe it or it becomes something that shunts you away from the work you need to be doing. So I had not meditated at this point, but I was stoned enough to be having trimodal hallucinations. So then I started to, you know, the thing, what do you do when you're stoned? The three classic things are music, sex, and eating. So I got the munchies and I started to eat this brownie. The brownie didn't have anything in it. I didn't need to. I was already quite baked. So I'm eating this brownie and in retrospect, see as a meditation teacher now, retrospectively I can analyze what happened. I didn't know the categories at the time to understand, but obviously I dropped deep because I was having significant makyo. And I really got into tasting this brownie. So in retrospect, there was a spontaneous state of samadhi or high concentration, very high concentration. I was just eating this brownie and just getting into eating the brownie. And the brownie had inhomogeneities. There were, for example, air pockets and the surface of the air pockets were of a different texture from the surface of the, from the cake quality of the other parts, etc. So now I'm detecting all sorts of detail. So that's a second important sensory attentional skill, which is sensory clarity. So I'm highly concentrated. I'm detecting a lot of detail. So I'm in a spontaneous mindful state. And so the way that mindfulness practice works is you bring three skills, concentration, clarity and equanimity to sensory experience and then ahas can occur as the result of that. That's why the term in Sanskrit vipassana, which corresponds to the Pali vipassana, you can see it's phonologically just slightly simpler. The v means apart. So vipassana means to see. So it means to see with discrimination, to discern detail, but it also means insight or the aha experiences. So that's why sometimes there's confusion about the word vipassana, because in some traditions it's an analytic observation and in other traditions it's an attainment of a certain wisdom function. And those are two very different meanings of the word and sometimes you see people contentious about this, not realizing that the word is used differently in different lineages. So in retrospect, I had dropped deep because from a Zen analysis I was having a trimodal bakyo. And my memory was of high concentration. It was just nothing but that brownie and a lot of sensory clarity. So sure enough, I had beginner's luck, which is not uncommon. People can have this kind of thing. As I bit into one of the air holes in my mental talk space, I hear, oh, the holes taste as good as the cake. And then there was a spontaneous activation of the wisdom function, prajna, we call it. The distinction between existence and non-existence evaporated. Duality just went away and something shifted inside me. I came down from the drugs, but that shift didn't immediately vanish. It hung around for a couple of weeks. And I was in this magic world. And from that time on, I didn't think that Buddhism was just speculation or fabricated bullshit. It's like, holy shit, these people are actually trying to describe something. They didn't just make it up. So that made it real. It was like, oh, no, there's something here. There's something to Buddhism. Because it was a very Buddhist experience and a very non-dual experience. I mean, it's like classic. It's classic Zen. You know, the classic story, \u72d7\u5b50\u6709\u4f5b\u6027,\u6709\u72d0, dog, have Buddha nature, yes or no. The classic \u6709, \u72d0, existence, non-existence. That koan, like many of them, is supposed to take you beyond that fundamental duality. And so that actually happened just out of nowhere. Well, not out of nowhere. It came out of the state of spontaneous, uncultivated state of high concentration and sensory clarity. And so from that time on, I took it seriously. But the state wore off. Now, the reason it wore off, once again, now as a professional teacher, I can look back and make a complete analysis, a clear analysis. So remember I said, concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. Well, I lucked out. I spontaneously went into a transient state of high concentration and sensory clarity, and it actually initiated a wisdom function. Because there was mental talk. It was just an ordinary thought that holes taste as good as the cake. But then with that went this earth-shaking change in the way I thought about everything. But it wore off, and I went back to being not in that world, but remembering that. And this happens to people all the time. I think you're familiar with the Tenzin ox-herding pictures. So this is, you saw the tail, okay? You didn't really see the ox, and you certainly did not get on the ox. So why is it that people have these experiences, which they do? This kind of thing happens to people, and usually not associated with drugs, but whatever. I mean, the drugs are a red herring in this case. I mean, I think they made it happen, but when they wore off, that change was still there for a little while. So why did it fade? Well, first of all, it was a temporary state of concentration and clarity. I didn't have concentration and clarity skills available to me. That came a long time later as a result of training. And I did not have equanimity skills, which is the ability to allow sensory experience to come and go without push and pull. So I got lucky, but the old habits of duality or identification with thoughts, emotion, and the physicality of the body, those old habits reasserted themselves. Now, a person with training can deconstruct that recrudescence of selfhood. They can deconstruct it and bring equanimity to it, so they don't get incarcerated again if you've had training in those attentional skills. But if you just got lucky and you don't have training in those attentional skills, in most cases, when the habitual identification with mental image, mental talk, physical and emotional sensations in body, when those habits reassert themselves, you don't have the ability to stay hold that wisdom function and that enlightenment experience, so it fades into a significant but no longer present shadow or memory. So I'd actually gotten a little taste, so that changed. Then when I completed all my coursework pretty quickly because I'd gone in knowing a lot of languages that typically take you a long time to learn, well, I had a huge head start from teenage, right? So I'd already done original research just on my own before I even was in graduate school. So I was ready within two years to be sent back to Japan to do research on. At first, I thought I would do research on the Obaku school since I'd started with that. But my major professor, I had two professors that I really loved that were my advisors at Wisconsin, Kiyota Minoru, Kibe, Kibenike, do you know what that means? Kibe means born in the US but decided to go back to Japan, sort of have a Japanese education and then return to the US. So they're Japanese-Americans that can function as Japanese, and that's a certain kind of Japanese-American. Basically, they're fluent in both worlds. So Kiyota Sensei was that. So we got along really well because we shared. I remember the first time I met him, I said, well, I went to Japanese school, I'm fluent. He said, oh, okay. He pulled out a highly scholarly modern Japanese book in the field of Buddhist studies and just opened it up and said, okay, read it. I just, you know, he was impressed. Wow. Because that was my first meeting with, right? I'm not in graduate, well, I'm not at Wisconsin yet, right? So he saw I wasn't bullshitting. He had had to, of course, work very hard. He was born in the US, right? So he had gone through the struggle of becoming very fluent in spoken and written Japanese and so forth. So we had an intersection. So got along great with him. He suggested I not do Obaku, but I do Shingon, which is Japanese Vajrayana. I don't remember why he said it would give me a better academic, bona fides for some reason. And then my other mentor and role model was Richard Robinson. Now you've probably never heard of him, although the world would have if he hadn't died tragically in an accident. And he was my absolute ideal of what I want to be when I grow up. Because he had all those languages and a lot more. His specialty was Buddhist logic, Nagarjuna, and spanning all the Buddhist cultures, the Tibetan, the original Sanskrit, even how that had been translated into Chinese. Because the Chinese first encountering with syllogistic thinking and so forth, that came in through Buddhism. And there was a famous book by an early Russian Buddhologist, Shchebatsky, who wrote a book on Buddhist logic based on the way logic is taught. He was Russian, so he probably learned it from Mongols who were Tibetanized, I'm guessing. So what happened was the whole tradition of logic and using logic to sort of deconstruct the normal perceptions of things, that developed in India with the school of Madhyamaka and Nagarjuna. And it's very much a Buddhist version of Parmenides and the Eliatic school of Zeno and so forth. Very similar arguments. In fact, this is not in my area, but if I were to hazard to guess, I'm going to suspect direct Greek influence there, not the other way around. But who knows. Anyway, Nagarjuna attempted to use logic to show that if you believe in anything dualistic, it leads to a contradiction, and therefore the world must not be dualistic. So, that was Robinson's specialty, but he did it spanning all Buddhist cultures. I mean, you might do it with Tibet, that's impressive. You might do it with Tibet and complete fluency with the Sanskrit writings, that's even more impressive. But he did it not just with that, but with all the East Asian stuff. So, that's really impressive. And this was before I was able to do things like logic and math, so it looked so beyond my intellectual capacities. And he knew all the culture, and he could pun in three languages in one sentence. Just incredible intellect. He's Canadian, but educated in the UK in Indian studies. So, I got along really well with him, and he was my role model. He had been married, but he was getting a divorce, and there was this really lovely girl that he was in a relationship with who was in our department. And they were living together, and a fuse blew out, so he went down into the basement to replace it, and it was dark, so he lit a match to a lamp light, and there had been a leaky something there, and he just went up like a torch. And I wasn't there though. In Madison at the time, I was already in Japan, but I got a letter from Willard Johnson, one of the people that was in the department that I was very close with, describing to me what had happened, and it was shocking. It was just devastating. He would have been, it was like burned all over his body. He would have been horribly disfigured and blind, but they thought he was going to live, but he just was in agony for a month and then died. So, as you know, there is something called the first noble truth in Buddhism, Arya Dukasacca, the noble truth of suffering, and it's like, oh, that really brought it home. So, you've got an intellect the size of the state of Wisconsin, and all this knowledge, but what good is it when your mind and body is just a shard of fiery agony of no use whatsoever? So, I had a taste of something beyond. I was in Japan, and they had basically told me that we're not going to teach you anything about Shingon unless you practice it. You have to become a monk. So, that made it real. It's like, okay, I'm going to become a monk and I'm going to practice this because, first of all, I've had a taste, and secondly, oh my God, the potential for suffering is just too huge. I've got to have a recourse. So, that's what made it real for me. So, by the time I was ordained and they started to tell me what old school training was going to entail, even though I'm basically an impatient wimp probably by genetics and certainly by conditioning and early life, I was ready to do it. Now, coming out of your, not only what you just described in terms of your genetics and your conditioning, but we're coming out of this late 60s period where by your own description, there's a lot of, for lack of a better word, maybe indulgence going on. And this was also a time of not only experimentation with drugs, but also there was a sexual revolution happening. There was a lot of just monumental changes going on in the world at the same time, in a sense being fueled by and counterbalanced by conflict in our case back then, Vietnam. I don't know how much of a concern there was or a danger there was of you being drafted, for example, at that point. But as you are now at the threshold of making this major commitment, which by our standard Western American measurement is a radical choice to make, how are you viewing what was going to have to be the renunciation of so much of that in light of the insight that you were having? Well, to be honest, it didn't seem so bad because I knew that it was a temporary training. It would just be a few years, then I would, if I really liked it, I might stay in that environment. But it's not like it was a lifelong commitment to live a certain lifestyle. And so I saw it more, well, you know the thing about glass half empty, glass half full. So I saw it more as a way to be high, actually, than as giving up something. I was going to actually get something because I had that taste. Now Shingon also, as I know, entails, it's an esoteric path in many ways, and entails a certain amount of what we would perhaps describe with the word secrecy. Well, that is exactly what it is. In fact, it's called in Japanese, mikyo, which means secret teachings. And in Chinese, it's called mizong, which means the secret school. So I guess I'm wondering about the issue of trust within this maybe temporary arrangement in part. All they required was that you would be willing to do the training. I was given essentially all the secrets, the complete, I think they call it, what's the name? It's a technical name in Japanese. When they basically, well, you complete something called kegyo, it's a hundred days of intensive training in isolation. And essentially you learn how to do all the mudras, mantras, and visualizations. They show you, you meet with the teacher, and that's the only person you meet with for the hundred days. And they show you face to face, here's how to do the mudras, here's how to pronounce the mantras. The mantras are pronounced in a special Japanese pronunciation of Sanskrit. Let's see, what would be an example? I'm trying to think of something representative. I can't quite remember. I might remember later on. Like vajra in Sanskrit is pronounced bhanzara, so it's somewhat modified. Namo ratna tarayaya. I bow to the three jewels. That would be namo karatanno tarayaya. You can still hear it as Sanskrit. And they write it in a form of Devanagari alphabet, actually, a Sanskrit alphabet made its way. And most people don't know this, but the organization of the Japanese language in terms of the phonology of the kana, a, i, u, e, o, kaki, kuke, ko, sashi, kuku, seso, nani, nune, no, mami, mume, mo, like that, which I learned as a young person, that's based on the arrangement of phonemes in Sanskrit and was done by Shingon monks. So it's a direct influence on basically Japanese linguistics before contact with the West, in terms of phonology anyway. It was directly influenced by Panini, the grammar of India, through the Vajrayana monks, the Shingon monks, because they had to learn the Sanskrit and they had to learn to write it to a certain degree, because it's all about the power of the mantras, right? So you've got to get that. So you get initiated and in that hundred days, you basically, you don't learn every ritual, but you learn enough so that you could do every ritual. And no, because I'd waited around for a year and I'd proved myself. And how then, I mean, obviously you were accepted, but how did you feel the level of acceptance was of you? In this case, what was your knowledge or awareness of anyone, so-called outsider, non-Japanese, non-Asian, going through this experience? I will have to say that in all my experiences in Japan, both as a student for a year and as a Buddhist monk for three years, I was never aware of a scintilla of racism or being othered. Not at all. Maybe because I was so unusually fluent in the language and I had the body language. I just acted the way they act, talked the way they talk, thought the way they thought. I was totally collectivist. I was like totally in it. I had a Japanese personality by that time. So yeah, I might have looked different, but I think that I was enough like them that I just, I mean, there might have been some thoughts because well, you looked different, that's for sure. But I never felt anything. I just felt like I was Japanese. I mean, if I didn't look in the mirror, I never saw anything but Japanese. I dreamed in Japanese. So then what was this ultimately the experience like for you of ordaining and becoming a Shingon monk? Once again, there was a moment. So because of the experiences that I mentioned, getting a little hint of the real deal, but not being able to sustain it and then being really hit by the potential for suffering, I was psychologically ready. But also it's pretty scary when they started to tell me what's going to be involved, okay? Because it was the traditional way of training, it's old school. It was one student with one master and you're in isolation for a hundred days. And it's in winter and you really don't have much of a source of heat. So you're in Japanese buildings. Yes, not insulated. There's a blizzard outside and there's paper between you and the blizzard. I'll turn it on again. All right, we're back. So it's a blizzard outside and there's paper between you and the blizzard. Japanese clothes are great for the summer, air goes right through, not so great for the winter. So you do three rituals a day, but the form is ritual, but they're actually meditations. I didn't know that they were meditations, but in retrospect I now understand that. The external form would appear to be what the Hindus would call a puja. You're evoking a deity, you're making offerings, but while you're doing that you are absolutely developing meditative skills. So you do three ceremonies, three of these rituals per day. They take varying amounts of time. Some are pretty quick, just half an hour, an hour, something like that, but some of them take several hours. And then you have to also do mini pilgrimages. You walk to this place called the Okunoin, which is where the founder is interred and believed to be still in Samadhi, in a cave. So you're walking around doing these pilgrimage things, which would be a meditation in motion kind of thing. So you're basically being forced to meditate all your waking hours for a hundred days, and you're never comfortable for a hundred days. So then this master, who I had sought out because he was described as the last fully traditional Shingon teacher, in the sense that he trained one-on-one the old-fashioned way, because nowadays they do group training at Mount Koya. It's a little bit modeled after Zen, which is group training, but that's not the traditional Shingon way. The traditional Shingon way is one acolyte with one teacher training in isolation. And Nakagawa Zenkyo, who was the abbot of the Shinnoin Temple, where I was, which is one of the several hundred temples on Mount Koya, he was known as sort of the last person that did it the old-fashioned way. And maybe it was Kyoto, I can't remember, but someone said that if you're going to do this and then do your thesis on it, you should do it with the last guy that's doing it the old-fashioned way. Providentially, Bishop Takahashi, who was the head at that time of the big Koya Sanbetsuin Temple downtown, which is the branch, he was good friends with Nakagawa. And so I approached him to give me a shokajo, a letter of introduction, which he very graciously did. So I actually had an official letter of introduction, which is very important in Japan, coming from the head of the U.S. Shingon Mission. And Takahashi, they called him Bishop Takahashi, he was very charismatic and he was the head of that whole operation for a long time. It was, and I'm guessing is, a pretty big operation. As you know, it's a plop in the center of J-town. And it's pretty noticeable and pretty cool, with all the ornate. Very traditional architecture. So basically what happened was I showed up there with my shokajo, and with my impeccable Japanese, and with the knowledge of Sanskrit and classical Chinese and Jogo-san. Nakagawa's title was Jogo, that's a rank. They have dozens of ranks, they're very, very status conscious. Jogo is way up there. So Jogo-san basically gave me what in Japanese is called monbarai. It means, how would I translate that? Sent away without even getting in the gate. Couldn't even get in the door. Monbarai. Literally, I showed up at the gate of the temple and he said, get out of here. It's cool to read about this kind of stuff, the stories of the masters. You know what, I can tell you in real life, it's not cool at all. It's like, fuck this shit. I've got all these qualifications and I've never failed in Japan. I've always been able to charm my way into everything. And this guy basically wouldn't let me in the gate. So I kept coming back because I knew that's what you had to do, you just keep coming back. And he kept me waiting for a year before he'd let me in the gate. I had to go to another temple I'd arranged so at least I could be on Mount Koya. And I'm waiting around and asking and asking and asking, which actually turned out to be very good because that's when some kind person started to teach me how to meditate. Because I never would have been able to survive the keikyo training if one of the professors at Koyasan University, Nakagawa, oh my god, my memory is really sleepy, Okamura Keishin, he was, of all things, a professor of German philosophy at Koyasan University, but he was a Zen practitioner and a Shingon monk. And he had a Zen sitting group there and he befriended me and taught me actually how to meditate. And I was so clueless about how meditation actually works that, I'm trying to remember when I first met Okamura, yeah, I think he was the sponsor for the sumo team, Mount Koya sumo team. And my friend, I had a friend that was on the sumo team. And so I started to, they were practicing or whatever, and I started to have a conversation with the faculty member that sponsored it. Okamura was a real right-winger, he was just a real right-winger in terms of Japanese culture, but he was very kind to me. Once again, just having a white face didn't seem to really mean anything. But he was into everything that was, I mean, even though he was a, taught Western philosophy, he was definitely a very old-fashioned Japanese. So he would have been, I'm imagining, a militarist if given the choice. So we have this situation of, which really makes you sort of think, essentially, my father's mortal enemies saved my ass. So just really makes you think about things. So anyway, we strike up this conversation and I say I'm waiting around to try to get into shinnoin, they won't let me in, I want to do the kegyo, etc. And he says, well, if you're going to do kegyo, you should learn how to meditate. I think he probably said zazen, do sitting practice. And I remember the thoughts, well, what's sitting practice have to do with Vajrayana rituals? It's like, well, there's no connection. So I had all the information, I just didn't have any understanding of how the whole thing works. I didn't know that the rituals were in fact meditation, but it was providential, because if he'd let me in right away, I don't think I could have survived at all. But fortunately I had sort of grandfatherly, kind person that sort of showed me, okay, here's how you sit, here's how you focus, here's what samadhi is, okay, here's how to deepen it, and just showed me how to do it. So by the time that I was accepted into the monastery, Shinno-in, it's called, S-H-I-N-N-O-apostrophe-I-N, has a very interesting history. It was founded by one of Kukai's early disciples, who was an imperial prince, and is known to anybody that knows much about Japanese history. His name was Shinno, Shinno, and actually that's where the Shin of my name comes from. Shinno, Shinno, Shinno means an imperial prince, so his actual name was Shinno, which translates to Sanskrit, Tatata, or suchness. He was the first Japanese person, and this was back in the ninth century, or yeah, ninth or tenth century, the first Japanese person to attempt to visit the Western world. Now at that time the Western world for them meant India, but that was the far, far west from Japan. I mean, India might as well have been Europe, as far as being very west and very different. And after all, India is, North India is Indo-European. I mean, it is an extension of the Hellenistic, or at least the culture, I guess, of the classical world. What we think of as Western. Yeah, I think of India as the most eastern part of the west. So he didn't trust the Chinese Vajrayana teachers. He wanted to go right to the source, study with people in India directly, which given the difficulties of travel at that time, it was hard enough to go to China. It was extremely difficult just to go to China, and to go beyond China, and for Chinese it was extremely difficult to make it to India. So to make it from Japan to India is almost an impossibility, given all the barriers. And sure enough, he never made it past Singapore. But there's a monument to him. He died in Singapore, and he, Shinyo, and he was the first Japanese to attempt to visit the west. So that's really something. So that temple has been there ever since it was started by that guy. So I'm in the temple of the first Japanese to attempt to visit the western world, with a lineage that goes back a thousand years. And my name, there's an overlap of one kanji per generation. My teacher was Zenkyo, so I got the Shinzen. My students are all called something something Shin. I mean, if they want a name, I don't encourage it particularly, but people do. So there's all these people like Choshin, Myoshin, Kenshin. They got lineage names from that place. Myoshin Gonzales is very prominent. Have you ever heard of her? You know who she is. So that's my lineage. That's my name. She's very prominent in the business world, bringing mindfulness in big time. Yeah, so that's where the Shin comes from in her name. So anyway, so providentially, Okamura Sensei taught me how to meditate. So by the time, I mean the nitty-gritty of how to meditate, someone has to show you. It's like playing the piano. Someone just has to sit down with you and coach you through it. So fortunately, by the time Nakagawa let me in, I was motivated for the reasons I mentioned, and I had some resources, but just some resources. I was just a beginning, beginning meditator. And so I'm waiting around, and first he lets me in, but he says, I'm not going to teach you anything, but you can work around the temple. So I was working around the temple. This is such a classic scenario. Yeah, of course it is, because that's the way it is, and that's the way it is everywhere. The Muslims do the same thing. Sufis go through exactly that progression. I have an American friend that has gone through the full traditional Mevlevi Sufi practice in Konya, in Turkey, and they put him through exactly the same sequence. So it's pretty universal. So anyway, it's like, okay, you can be here, but you're going to work around the temple. So chopping wood, carrying water, raking, the masters, garden, it all sounds very exotic, but I can tell you it gets old really quick. It's shit work. It's just boring. And I was bored. I was like, I came here to meditate, and I'm just doing this shit work. But Okamura, thank God for him, he just said, I mean, I'm giving a colloquial translation, but essentially, dude, that is your meditation, raking the sand. And then I got it. Okay, right. That's the samadhi. When you're doing this, you focus on this. When you're doing this, you... And then you start to taste samadhi and, oh yeah, now I'm moving around and I'm washing the dishes and whatever, and I'm in the same state as when I'm sitting. So he showed me how to do that. So then I'm just working around the temple, and he says at some point, okay, you've been working and you memorized the whole litany, liturgy rather, for the morning. There's this hour-long chant that they do, and it's in a very special form of Japanese, and I memorized it. I think that impressed him a little bit. So I said, okay, I'm going to make you a monk. You can ordain with the big ordination that we're going to have. I think it was in September or October, something like that. October, I think. But there's no guarantee I'm going to teach you anything, but you can become a monk. So I went through the traditional thing. It's a big ceremony. They shave your head, they give you robes. Now you're a monk. And there's this very moving moment in that ceremony. They have three hanging calligraphy rectangles, a little bit like kakemono, that are hanging. And it says in kanji, fubo, kokuo, ujigami. I can still remember. Parents, king, and clan gods. And you bow three times to each one and say goodbye. You're leaving all that behind. It's really something. And so now I'm a Shingon monk, and I've already been there like a year, two years. I lose track of time. I've been there a while. So I'm pretty sure I was ordained in October of 1970. Could be a little wrong. All the official documents are there in Japan if anyone ever wanted to find them. So now it's starting to get cold again. It's turning into winter. He says, okay, you're going to start on the first day of winter for a hundred days, and here's what it's going to be. And so he described what I described to you. And then he said, now there's something that we do that's strictly speaking not part of Shingon, but it has become part of the traditional training. It's called mizugori, which means cold water purification. And he actually told me that it was more part of Shinto, meaning more part of shamanic vision questing. But remember, shamanic vision questing is on a continuum with fudryana visualizations. I mean, hey, it's not unrelated, right? If you want to see the gods one way or another, deep deprivation, hot, cold, pain, this is what people do. I was in a sweat lodge ceremony last night with some Native American friends of mine, sun dancers. So they do the hot thing, right? The sweat lodge, the sun dance, which you wouldn't think a human being could even do, but they do. So they do the hot thing. Japanese like the cold thing. It has the same effect. So before each one of the ceremonies or the rituals that you do, you've got to go to this frozen cistern, break the ice, fill this bucket with freezing water, and go into the bathing area, which has a wooden floor, of course, and take off all your clothes and pour it all over you. So it was so cold that the water, when it hit the wooden floor, it would actually freeze into a patina of ice. So I'm slipping around barefoot on ice. Now, the Japanese concept of a towel is our concept of a washcloth. They don't waste stuff. And you can dry with a washcloth. You don't need a giant beach towel. So I've got this little thing trying to dry my body off, and it's so cold that the towel is actually freezing in my hands. I have to knock the ice off of it. So I'm slipping around on this icy surface trying to dry myself with a frozen towel. So I mentioned there was a moment, and the moment came about three days into this, exactly three days into this. So what I had noticed is that if I stayed in some sort of state of concentration, because thank God I at least knew how to do that in theory, so if I really worked hard and stayed in a state that was highly concentrated, it would reduce my perceived misery. But as soon as I went out of a concentrated state, I was in this frozen hell. In Buddhism, there's eight hot hells and eight cold hells, and I was in one of the cold hells. So I realized on day three that I am facing a well-defined trichotomy. It's exactly one of three things that is going to happen. I'm going to be completely miserable for ninety-seven days, or I'm going to give up and just say, I can't do this. Or I'm going to work my ass off to stay as focused as I can all my waking hours, because that's the only thing that is going to make this bearable. So what it is, is a giant 24-7 biofeedback device. As long as you're staying in what the Christians would call a recollected state, or what in Buddhism is called some level of samadhi, you can sort of get by. But as soon as you leave that, it's like, forget this. This is untenable. So I had three choices. Like I say, there was a moment. It's like, okay, well, I think I'm going to try to just do my best. So essentially the upshot of that was that I went in one person and a hundred days later I came out a very different person. I had been fundamentally re-engineered. And in retrospect, it was a small price to pay for a new life, a new kind of life, really. So that's the story. And once you had re-emerged as this essentially re-tooled person, what did you do? What was your next step in your life? Well, I had come there with the intention of training for one year and then returning to the United States. As the only Western scholar that knew anything about Japanese Vajrayana, people were very interested in Tibet. And there was a lot of study going on. The Dalai Lama had already become a celebrity. And Shogyun Trungpa was really taking off. And lots of Rinpoches and great teachers. Tibetan Buddhism was catching on, but people in the academic Buddhist world knew that there was another form of Vajrayana, Mikyo, East Asian esoteric Buddhism. And it's historically very important. And I was going to be the Western expert on that. That was going to be my academic niche. And I would complete my PhD and then get an academic position like most of my friends eventually ended up doing. But I didn't think I was ready to write a thesis because I didn't think I had a sufficient experiential basis. Because when you write a PhD thesis on Buddhism, you're putting yourself in the position of critiquing Buddhism, of saying, hey, this is what it really means, and this is this and this is that, and we know better, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I did not think I was ready to do that because I knew that I was just beginning to have experience. So the upshot is that I stayed on for two more years at Mount Koya. And during that time, I spent one summer away in the city of Kyoto as a Zen monk. So I was basically in full-time monastic training for approximately three years in Japan. Then I came back. But by that time, my academic interests had shifted. I was no longer interested in Asian culture. I mean, I like it, and I enjoy it, but I wasn't obsessed with it the way I had been. It was just a culture, and I like Western culture too. I wasn't really passionate about culture, and I wasn't actually so passionate about the academic study of Buddhism. But I was very passionate about the practice of meditation. My teachers had always emphasized that the purpose of doing this training would eventually be to return to the United States and teach, help people. Teach not in the academic sense, but in the sense of being a meditation mentor. So after three years, it was time to do that. But by that time, my intellectual interests had shifted. In terms of what was important for me, the practice of meditation was important. Even before leaving Japan, I had already begun teaching people meditation. So the teaching and practice of meditation was the center. But I think because of the Jewish background, very early conditioning in the notion of excelling academically. You know, in traditional Judaism, Orthodox Judaism, men don't work. They just study their whole lives. Well, no, not Orthodox. That's ultra-Orthodox. The ultra-Orthodox communities, the men don't work. They just study their whole lives and often live in poverty, and this is considered admirable. The women are baby factories, but that's a whole other thing. But I think that I am grateful for at least part of that, because that notion of studying your whole life and never stopping in the process of improving your intellect, I think I got a very strong subtext from my Jewish background or my synagogue, the people around me, that I don't know, I just picked it up. Somehow I picked it up, that you're going to hone your intellect your whole life. As I lost interest in Buddhist academics, I gained interest in Western science for the reasons I mentioned in the previous interview. And the person that actually was responsible for that, and this is a very interesting little cultural irony, was an Irish Jesuit Roman Catholic priest named Father William Johnston, who is actually a pretty well-known author. He's passed away, but he wrote a seminal book called Christian Zen. He was part of the Christian Buddhist dialogue. I've read that book. We were friends in Japan. I met him on a Zen retreat, and we became friends, and he vastly broadened my appreciation of the world mystical traditions. Because up until my encounter with Father Johnston, I actually thought that meditation and enlightenment experiences only happened in Buddhism. I really didn't know how universal a contemplative experience was. And he was a Jesuit, he was an academic, he taught at Sofya University, Jochi Daigaku, which is a Catholic Jesuit university, old famous place in Tokyo. So he lived in the Jesuit house in Tokyo, and he had an enormous private personal library in the field of world comparative mysticism. And when he would travel, he would let me stay in his apartment, his room in the Jesuit house. So I would just avidly read, and it was like, oh my God, even in Judaism, there's a whole Jewish meditation tradition that I never knew about. And of course, because he's Christian, I got a respect for the Christian way to go about meditation. So he really did me a big favor by broadening my perspective from, hey, it's not just Buddhists that do this stuff. But it went much further, because he had been friends with these Japanese researchers who were doing brainwave research on Zen meditators. So Japan's been a modern country for a while. It was the first country in Asia to go modern. So there are Buddhist universities in Japan, and they have departments of physiology just like any other university. And you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that when you're doing Zazen, it's impacting your physiology. So the Japanese started to do brainwave studies and other physiological monitoring of Zen meditators before anyone. I think maybe even before World War II, they were already doing this kind of stuff. So Father Johnston, Father Bill, as I called him, and everyone else did, Father Bill, he knew a couple of researchers at Komazawa University, which is a Soto Zen university, who were doing brainwave studies on Zen meditators, but they'd also done him, Father Bill. Of course he had the same physiological signature as the Zen meditators doing Zen, but it was still interesting to them that it's a different race, a different religion, but same physiology. So that was scientifically interesting. So he knew these people, and he took me to the brainwave where they were doing it, and I think I might have had my brainwaves monitored. And Father Bill was very excited at the notion that, at least at one time, he came to me all excited, the notion that science would legitimize spirituality was a delicious idea to him, being a Jesuit, an intellectual, because there had been this, it's still actually a classic study, a very good study, by Hirai and Kasamatsu, I think from Tokyo University, Todai. That's probably your colleague. No, that's someone else's call. You can find an English translation of this study in a book called Altered States. Do you know that book by Charles Tart? Charlie Tart and I are very good friends, we've been friends forever. And Charlie's responsible for the phrase altered states becoming commonly used. So I'm pretty sure that he's got the Hirai and Kasamatsu study in that book. And what it essentially showed is that there's a report that Zen meditators give, which is that the world is fresh, it's anew moment by moment. And that that effect is that the longer you do Zazen or Zen practice, the more dramatic that sense of there's just now, there's just now, there's just now becomes. Okay, so that's a subjective claim. And in science, subjective claims are meaningless. Anyone could say anything. You can't falsify it. So it doesn't mean anything. What Hirai and Kasamatsu did was design a clever physiological study that would tend to give credence to that claim. There's something called orienting response. If a new stimulus is introduced into the environment, there's an orienting response. It is the brain's signature of novelty. Something's new. If you continue to introduce that stimulus, the orienting response goes away because it's not new anymore. So they took a bunch of experienced Zen meditators and a bunch of people that weren't, had them sit there in the same posture and hooked them up to scalp electrodes that monitor the surface potential that the brainwave or the signature, the voltage signature that you can read off the scalp. And they introduced a click stimulus and both groups showed an orienting response. And then they continued to introduce the click stimulus. And the non-meditators did what the physiology books say always happens. They acclimatized and the orienting response extinguished. But the Zen meditators, it never extinguished, which is a new result and would tend to give credence to the claim that indeed they were experiencing each moment as new because the physiological signature of novelty remained. That's a very clever experiment that any scientist is going to look at and they're going to say, okay, that's a piece of evidence. It doesn't prove their claim, but it's definitely consonant with their claim. And that's what you're looking for. You get enough of that, I think they call it conciliants, enough evidence starts to point in the same direction and you start to have confidence. So here we have a hard-nosed science result that's tending to back up a spiritual claim. Well that turned him on, at least at that time, I don't know, later in life. And he turned me on. And that's when I got that perception, okay, my next intellectual challenge is to master science. And I'll continue as a meditating practitioner and I'll continue to teach and that's all I really care about. But on the side, I'm going to learn science, which I have no ability for whatsoever because I flunked every one of my science courses and specifically I have no ability at math. And it was a big, big emotional storm when I would come back with Ds and Fs in math because my dad was good at it and he would get very angry, so I had all sorts of emotional scarring around this. But I was not the same person. I'd been re-engineered thanks to the Japanese monastic system, so I could approach it in a very different way. And that was another moment because, although I didn't know it, cosmic forces were lining up around the world, all pointing vectorially in the direction of this science, meditation, cross-fertilization meme. And once again, I made the right choice early on to be continued. Yes, to be continued. We're going to have to pick up again in January when you come back. Yeah, but it's January. It's January. It's not that far off. And we'll hear where this all went and specifically what your teaching began to look like and what forms it took and where it happened when you came back to Los Angeles. Yeah, that's quite a story. Well, we're going to get into that next time. Well, I'll give you as much as you can stand. I mean, it's easy and fun for me. If the research that I'm engaged in now with some of these labs, if it works out, which low probability, but very, very large payoff, if we get very lucky, this actually all becomes very important. I mean, to put it bluntly, I become an important figure, which is not the way I think about myself currently, but there is the remote possibility that this might be important historical resources. There we go. And to me and others, it already is. So if it's\u2014 Yeah, big fish in a little pond. There you go. But I'm thinking of doing something in a very big pond, basically revolutionizing the medical establishment around the world so that enlightenment is part of medicine. Sounds good to me. All right. So that would be big, right? That would be very big. They'd want to know something about me, and you're getting what is probably the most detailed data dump. Okay. Well, we need that.
