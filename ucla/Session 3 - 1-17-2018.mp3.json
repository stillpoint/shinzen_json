{"text": " All right, here we are again, six months later. This is Alex Cline interviewing Shinzen Young, this beautiful home here in Pacific Palisades. It's January 17th, 2018. It's a new year. Happy New Year. And this is session number three. Good morning. We left off last time with the end of your training years at Mount Koya in Japan, your introduction to this Tokyo study that was mapping the brainwave activity. Did I mention that that was through a Roman Catholic priest, Father William Johnston? Yes, right. Yes, indeed. I might also mention for the record, since you said something about the beautiful house we're in. Yes. So this is Anne Buck's house, and she was also very central in the history of Los Angeles, because her husband that she just mentioned was Paul Newman's best friend and lawyer. And so they were very close to the Newman's that then put them in the center of the entertainment world in the 70s and 80s here. So it's a lot of Hollywood history around this house, just FYI. Yeah, yeah. And it's something that's almost inescapable when one is talking about the history and culture of this part of the world. So where we want to pick up today is from when you returned from your time in Japan, and during the 1970s, we'll be in the early 70s now, and this ultimately becomes the beginning of your teaching years. But from what you can remember, what did you do when you first came back to the United States? You mentioned that you were still considering finishing your PhD project, but that you ultimately did not. What form did all that take? And largely what I'd like to know is, after that experience that you had at the monastery on Maikoya in Japan, what was it like for you to come back here? It was very interesting. First of all, we're talking about events that are quite a long time ago, so I'm a little fuzzy on some of this stuff. I may have gotten the sequencing off and so forth. But I think I had mentioned that I spent a year abroad as part of the UCLA study abroad program in Japan. So that was one year in Tokyo as a university student. And then I returned and I graduated with an Asian language major from UCLA. Then I think I was sticking around UCLA for about a year doing graduate work there in Asian languages. That's where I met Dr. Thich Thien An. We're backing up now a little bit. Before I went to Maikoya, the Vietnam War was raging still. He was teaching Vietnamese at UCLA. Thich Thien An, Thich is a title carried by all Buddhist monks in Vietnam. It's actually from Thich Ka, which is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of Sha-Kya, which is the name of the tribe that Buddha came from. So they take it as a last name. Take Nhat Hanh, for example. So anyway, I met Thich Thien An. He was a leader in the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Vietnam, which had taken on political ramifications. So the US was trying to make friends with the Buddhist leaders of Vietnam. So one of the things that they did is they brought him over to be a visiting professor at UCLA. So it cemented the relationship between Buddhist power and the US when that had some political implications because we were still having this war there. So anyway, the thing was though, at that time he really couldn't speak English at all, but he was supposed to be teaching. He'd gotten his PhD in Japan, so he spoke Japanese just fine. Well, what happened was I wanted to learn Vietnamese because it was the happening thing. So there was a course in the Vietnamese language and he was teaching it, but as I say, he didn't know English very well. So what ended up happening is that he taught Vietnamese in Japanese at UCLA and I interpreted. I made it into an English language course in Vietnamese for him. Of course, you'll see later he learned the language very quickly, but he literally just got off a plane from, I think it was from Hue, that part of Vietnam. So anyway, this is going back, but it's a connection that then has significance later on. So I was around in graduate school at UCLA. That's where I met Dr. Tianan. Then of course, I went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and then I had all the things in Japan at Mount Koya that I talked about. So you asked me what was it like coming back and that coming back was the second coming back, right? I'd had a year in Tokyo and then I had three years in a Buddhist monastery. So a year in Tokyo is a year of living as a student in modern Japan. Three years in a Buddhist monastery is three years of living in a thousand year old time warp, literally living in a period piece movie in a sense, which you remember was my original motivation. I was like, I wanted to be a samurai, right? And I was very crestfallen when I discovered in my early teens, they didn't have them anymore. But the closest thing you could get to that would be to be a Buddhist monk because you are sort of living in a period piece movie. So it was really quite stunning and informative for me to contrast the difference in the two coming home experiences. So a year living as a student in modern Japan. When I got back, I had severe reverse culture shock, really severe. I mean, bordering on depression. I was pretty miserable for a while there, at least a year or so. Every day I was just thinking, I hate being here and I love being there. And this place is, being in the US, it's like barbarian compared to what I had come to expect on a day-to-day basis in Japanese culture. And that was just being a student in Tokyo. So my investment or involvement with traditional Japanese culture, of course, was incomparably deeper in a monastery, in essence, living in a period piece movie for three years. So I come back and in both cases, I came back through San Francisco. And the second time I'm back, I'm in San Francisco and I'm about to call my parents. And I realized that I'm completely happy being back here. There was not a scintilla of reverse culture shock, even though I had a longer immersion in a much more traditional setting. And the thought occurred to me, oh, living three years in a Buddhist monastery, it wasn't a training to be comfortable in a monastery. It was a training to be comfortable anywhere. And it really worked. It's like, there was no longing to go back. It's like, no, I'm here and it's the same as being there. So it was very interesting, a dramatic contrast. They train you not to be comfortable as a monk. They train you to be comfortable as a human being, independent of where you may be. So that was pretty cool and a big change. Then in the earlier parts of my life, I mean, my parents were great and they encouraged all of these enrichment activities that have paid off now, so noticeably. But there was also a lot of sturm und drang, a lot of screaming and crying and dysfunction, to be honest. And when I got back, I realized I had changed. And I didn't expect them to change, but I realized I had changed. And however they were, I wasn't going to let that cause me to regress to a less functional way of being. And it was amazing because within a few years, the whole family dynamic completely shifted. Now, I'm not taking all the credit for that, but I'll take some of the credit for that. So it was, I could see that I'd become a different person and I was impacting in a positive way my family. And after my father passed away, my mother came to me and asked me to teach her how to meditate. And for decades did the practice and of course that really changed things for her, for the better. So there was that. So now I'm back from that stay in the three years at Mount Koya and I call up my old friend, Dr. Thich Nhat Hanh, who in those intervening years, it was just a few years, he now spoke English. And he said, Oh, by the way, I have my own temple now here in LA. Why don't you come by? So I did. And that was the International Buddhist Meditation Center on New Hampshire Street. It's still there. And he said, Yeah, we're having a session, you know, a meditation week. Why don't you just join? And I was totally up for that because I spent the last three years essentially doing that. So yeah, okay, let's go for it. So when I got there, I told him about the science thing. I said, I was going to impress him with this new information. So I said, you know that there are scientists that are starting to study the brainwaves of meditators. And he said, Oh, yeah, I know. In fact, two of them are at this retreat. So I couldn't impress him very much. In fact, he impressed me as like, Whoa. And he remembered that my thing had been, well, when I come back to the West, what's my optimal use of being in the West? Well, I should learn something about this whole science thing, right? And it's like, I'm not back even just a few days, but lo and behold, oh, yeah, by the way, there's two brainwave researchers here at this very retreat. Actually, there were three. And the three were David Nolis, Ed Wartz, and Lester Femi. And Ed Wartz was the founder of the California Biofeedback Society. Nolis was another feedback guy. And Lester is still in the business. He has the Princeton Biofeedback Institute. Femi, F-E-H-M-I, his father was Turkish. So I was, it's like there's these three brainwave researchers right there. So after the retreat, I introduced myself. And I said, you know, I'd like to learn about this whole thing. And they said, Sure, come on down, come on down to the office. Retreat's over on Sunday. Come on Monday morning. And we'll have you try out our equipment. Now, mind you, this is when what is now called neurofeedback was called brainwave biofeedback. And it was just getting going. Actually, it was a guy at UCLA that started it. I'm trying to think of his name. We could look it up. He did stuff on cats. What was his name? Burn something. We could look that up. And then Joe Camia, who was up north, I think in the Berkeley area, or maybe at Langley Porter at the Neuropsychiatric Institute up north. I could be wrong about that, but he was starting to publish. And then so the brainwave biofeedback was just starting, just starting. And how incipient are we talking? Well, they had brainwave biofeedback machines. Warts had these machines, but these machines were custom built from scratch. You couldn't buy a brainwave biofeedback machine of any sort whatsoever. You had to make it. And these particular ones were very sexy because they had the NASA sticker on them. They'd been built by NASA because Warts worked for NASA as an engineer. He actually is the guy that designed the boots that walked on the moon. That was one of his projects. But he was also in the biofeedback field at the beginning and got NASA interested in the possibility of using biofeedback to train astronauts, which I don't think they ever did, although I'm not sure. But they built the machines. They had the resources to cobble together a brainwave biofeedback device. And so these were actually built at NASA. They were custom built. And so he let me play on his. And then I just went back day after day after day playing on the biofeedback machines. And I was off and running. I was connected now with one of the very things I was most interested in. And that relationship continued between me and those three people for many, many years. So I was there at the birth of neurofeedback, really. And eventually, actually, that's sort of how I started teaching because, what was that called? Council Grove. So yeah, there's a lot of history here. So the first training place in the US for psychologists was the Menninger Foundation. And the Menninger brothers had, I guess they were German and that stuff was going on in Germany and it wasn't in the US yet, or not much. Or at least there was no central training place for psychologists. So they decided, well, we could put it in New York, we could put it in LA, but we want it for the whole nation. So why not put it right in the middle in Topeka? And that's why the Menninger Foundation is there. Well, let's see, what was his first name? I am really forgetting stuff. Elmer Green and his wife, Alicia, I think, they were also pioneers in biofeedback. He's the one that discovered that theta is associated with enhanced creativity. So because Wartz was in the biofeedback field here in LA and Elmer was out there in Topeka at Menninger, Kansas of all places, right? Well, I think it was in association with Menninger. There was something, and I think it still exists, called the Council Grove Conference, where they would get scientists and spiritual leaders and artists to sort of come together and have presentations and do things together. You could look it up, but I'm pretty sure it's called Council Grove. So because of that whole connection, Ed Wartz being connected to Elmer, Elmer being connected to Menninger and the Council Grove, one year it fell to Ed to manage the Council Grove meeting for that year. So he invited me to teach publicly there. Up until then, I had only been teaching at Thich Nhat Hanh Center. What happened was eventually I moved in. I moved into that center. So it was called the International Buddhist Meditation Center and true to its name, it was international. There were people that did programs there or live there that represented the entire spectrum of Buddhist practice in Asia, everything. We had people that were involved in Tibetan things. We had Westerners who had been in Sri Lanka and done Theravada practice. We had Sri Lankan and Burmese and Thai teachers would come in and give programs, and of course, all the East Asian stuff, because Dr. Thien An, being Vietnamese, technically has a lineage from China in the Lam Te School, which is the Vietnamese version of Linh Chi or Rinzai Zen, although the specific lineage is through Liao Kuan. That was the name of one of the main Vietnamese masters. So that links to the whole East Asian thing, China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, sort of like East Asian hub. So we had all those cultures represented also. So it was this incredible spread in terms of the kinds of teachers, truly was international, which was pretty cool. Yeah. And unprecedented as far as I know. Yeah. But it was in a bad part of town because that's where the cheap real estate was. And a lot of the residents weren't particularly into meditation practice. They were just looking for a cheap place to stay. Mm-hmm. So you had quite a range of people. There's a Chinese expression, dragons and snakes all tangled together. Okay, dragons are like, they're awesome players, right? The snakes are just like little... Right, slithering on the ground. Yeah. But when they sort of tangle, it's hard to tell what's what. They're all like, they're in a gamish. So this was, I would characterize as dragons and snakes all tangled together. You'd have eminent masters that would come and give presentations. Mm-hmm. And then you'd have people, you'd always have at least one florid schizophrenic. And several people living as dope dealers. And I think there was some prostitution happening. Wow. It was crazy. And I loved that crazy mix at that time in my life that worked for me. I just love that crazy mix. And I sort of straddled both worlds. I think I was on a steady course to be a dragon, but I certainly had a lot of slithering left in me. How aware do you, was your sense of, or how aware do you think Dr. Tian An was of this dynamic? I think he was nobody's fool, and he was completely aware of all of this. And it was his capacity to hold all that, that was just amazing. But hey, he had a very deep practice. I was going to ask you what your impressions were of him as a person and as a teacher. Well, he was a scholar and a practitioner. That's a good combination. His specialty was the Yogacara school as it was transmitted to East Asia. So the Chinese texts of the so-called Chitta Matra or consciousness only, also known as the Yogacara or Yoga Vachara of Vasubandhu and Asanga, and that whole, he specialized in the East Asian version of all of that. But he had had a breakthrough experience. You could tell that he had seen, whatever you want to call it, no self, true self, oneness, emptiness. So I was sort of there, and I was doing a lot of meditation. And there was a small group that were interested in meditation practice, and we'd meet every morning and we'd meditate together and we'd meditate, yeah. Yeah, it was usually in the mornings. Then what would happen is, because I had been in Japan and I had training as a scholar, but also I'd had training as a meditator more than most of the people living there, the people that were interested in meditation started to come to me to ask me questions. So after we would meditate in the morning, we would go stand in the kitchen actually and I'd have a snack or something, and people would ask me questions about practice. And I was usually able to answer them. And then someone suggested, well, why don't we just formalize this? Why don't we have a meet on Monday evenings after dinner in the Zendo, in the meditation hall? We'll make it open to the public, and there'll be a meditation class that I would give there. And that's how it started. And at first it was just a few of the residents, then people started to come from the outside, then more people started to come from the outside. Then Ed wanted to push me, so he invited me to leave that little safe cocoon and be a presenter at Council Grove, which is this international event. And people loved it. It was very well received. And then they started to invite me back to Kansas. And then I think from that came an invitation to Tucson. And then I started a program there that still exists. I used to visit Kansas on a regular basis until a few years ago. I just got too busy. I still go back to Tucson. And then these other centers, just like, okay, we'll visit our city, visit our city. And these communities developed and have by and large persisted. Some of them I don't visit anymore, but they still exist. They took on a life of their own. So that's how I got started teaching. In terms of your meditation class when it started formally at the IBMC, demographically speaking, how would you characterize who that core of serious students were? Well, I think they were mostly Caucasian. Other than that, I think they were mostly not very wealthy. Yeah, that was just the beginnings of things. A lot of the ones that were living at the center were sort of hippie-like, and I was very hippie-like at that time. So I'm not entirely sure of the chronology, but somewhere, I'm pretty sure before I moved in there, I spent a year on the island\u2014well, eight months, yeah\u2014on the island of Formosa, living with a Chinese master, a real old-school Chinese master named Wu Guang Fa-she. Wu means awakened, Guang is light, so awakened to the light. Fa-she is just a title. How did that come about? I met him on Mount Koya. He's Taiwanese, meaning that his ancestors came from mainland China several centuries ago from the Fujian Coast to live on the island of Taiwan. So ethnically, culturally, they're Chinese, but first of all, they've been somewhat removed from the mainland of China, the Taiwanese people. Secondly, of course, there was a huge influx of people from all over China in what, 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek in the West, he lost to the communists. So they created, quote, nationalist China. So from a Taiwanese point of view, yeah, well, those people are Chinese, but they're not quite like us because we came from a different part of China and a long time ago. But there's another big difference between Taiwanese-Chinese of my teacher's generation and mainland Chinese, which is the experience of the Taiwanese being part of the Japanese empire was the diametric opposite of the experience of the Koreans being part of the Japanese empire. So both of those countries, or whatever you want to call them, Korea is obviously a country, Taiwan is whatever it is. When did Japan take Taiwan? I can't remember exactly, but it would have been after one of the wars, early wars with China. They took Korea, I think, after something, the war with Russia, Sino-Russian War, maybe a little later. I'm not quite sure, but those were two big pieces, colonial regions in the Japanese empire, probably the two biggest pieces. And Koreans and Japanese have never been a good match. So that's a really bad history for the Koreans. But the Taiwanese, many of them sort of liked the Japanese and it worked out for them. So they speak Japanese, my teacher's generation spoke Japanese quite fluently, like the fluent English of Bombay Indians or something, educated Bombay Indians. So I had met this Taiwanese master, I'm saying his name in Mandarin, Wu Guang. He was studying Shingon in Japan, not that he needed to study Shingon. He was an old school enlightened master. So why is he in Japan doing the basic training of Shingon? Well, that's sort of interesting, because he believed that the Vajrayana was the most powerful form of practice, especially if you wanted to use psychic powers to help people, which was very much part of his culture. Well, he felt Vajrayana was the most powerful. The problem is that most Chinese, if they want to study Vajrayana, will of course study with Tibetans. I mean, after all, depending on how you want to look at it, Tibet is either the closest Buddhist neighbor or it's actually part of China. And so Chinese interested in what's called Mitsong or esoteric, that's what they call Vajrayana. Mitsong in Chinese means secret teachings. Esoteric Buddhism is the English gloss on that. So my teacher wasn't alone in this regard. A lot of Chinese are attracted to the Vajrayana. So the problem is that translations are from Tibetan directly, and the culture is not that of China. It's a different culture. And sometimes a lot of the translations they use are actually Chinese translations of English translations of Tibetan Vajrayana or Sanskrit Vajrayana texts. So it's not an easy fit with their own culture. On the other hand, Shingon came to Japan from China in the Tang Dynasty. And the texts were all translated over a thousand years ago into Chinese, and they're in the Chinese canon. And they look like Buddhism to someone coming from traditional Chinese culture, whereas Tibetan practice looks like something pretty weird. So to have some sort of credibility to still be able to teach Vajrayana, but it be in a form that looks like Buddhism to Chinese Buddhists. His idea was, well, I'll go to Japan and I'll learn the Japanese version of all of that, because all the scriptures, they're not translated from something in English that was translated from something in Chinese, in Tibetan. Right? It's like, these have been around for over a thousand years in our Tripitaka, in the Chinese Buddhist canon. So that's why he was there. So it was sort of this weird thing of he was taking the same training I was taking, the kegyo, the basic training, but he was a far deeper teacher than any of his teachers there. Right? But he was just sort of going through the, he was going through the hoops he had to go through in order to get that lineage so he could go back and teach. He eventually became actually quite famous, but not in the English speaking world because he only spoke Taiwanese and Mandarin and Japanese. So, but he's got websites and followers in Asia now, he's passed away. So if you were to go on the Chinese internet, he has quite a presence, but not at all. I was the only Westerner. Well, yeah, probably. I sincerely doubt any other Western person studied, but I was impressed because he was willing to talk about everything. He was willing to talk about everything. He'd answer any question. And he wasn't and he wasn't, he didn't, I don't know, he was very transparent. He had been a merchant marine before becoming a meditation master. And I think he'd been a notorious badass actually. You know, the kind of sailor that can wipe out a bunch of guys on a pier, you know, in a fight. I think he'd been that kind of person. But then he became what he became. So he was very transparent. So for example, in Tibet, they have these six dharmas of Naropa, which are essentially, most of them fancy physical yoga practices linked to the experience of emptiness in very clever ways. So you bring the experience of emptiness down to a sort of cellular level by exploring altered physiology associated with sex or sleep or kundalini, etc, etc, etc. So one of those six practices is called the Powa, which is the putative ability to project consciousness out of your body so it's like out of the body experience but in a very controlled way and on steroids. Okay, so in order to, you can read about this easily, just look up the six yoga practices of Naropa, but you do this practice where you attempt to open up the fontanel, which is the closure, if you look at a baby's skull, the bones haven't fused yet, right? So there's a place where the parietal bones and the occipital and the frontal, there are these sort of soft spots that are cartilaginous, and then they become harder in the baby. That's why you never want to like press on a baby's head or something because there's no protection in the middle there. So in this practice, this Powa practice, you use breath and visualization to actually physically open up that structure again, because that's where you blow your consciousness out at the moment of death, putatively, to choose your next life. So, I mean, I'd read about this, right, but he'd actually done it, and he had mastered all six of those things, and that's a pretty big deal, right? I mean, those are some pretty intense attainments. So he said, yeah, yeah, it took 21 days and this hole opens up in the top of your head here. And he said, just press on the top of my head. I pressed on the top of my head and my finger went between his skull bones. It's like, holy shit. And I mean, it's like this huge indentation with my fingerprint, shaved, of course. So it's that kind of guy. It's like, oh, yeah, I drilled a hole in my head from the inside. You could do it too. Here, look. I was like, oh, yeah, we can talk about this. So I thought, this guy's really cool. And my Japanese, spoken Japanese is, well, at that time it was practically native, but it was always better than my spoken Chinese. And he, he was a very good speaker. And he, his Mandarin was okay, but his Japanese was really fluent. So he was someone I could just talk to very easily. And he'd never talked to a non-Asian person. So I was a little bit of a, probably an interesting thing for him. A novelty. Yeah. So anyway, I did have a year, almost a year living with this guy. That was an amazing experience. And that's folded in here somewhere in the chronology, but I did want to mention that. And what was Taiwan like then? Because this is well, it was, it became a huge economic. Yeah. Yeah. It was still, it wasn't like Korea was back then. Korea was really, it was still recovering from the Korean war. It was really, really bad. Taiwan was okay. It was a little bit more like Japan, even then. I loved it though. It was Chinese culture. It was a chance to immerse in that. So, yeah. And there's a lot of interesting things that happened, but maybe you want to get back to this. No, it's okay. I'm just mostly would like to know what sort of enhancement you had of your own learning and your own practice by being with him for ages. Well, actually, unfortunately, I didn't realize it at the time. I only found out when I got back that I was actually quite sick. Without quite knowing it, I had developed Graves' disease while I was there, or probably earlier, but it only became evident when I got back. So that's exophthalmic goiter, or a form of hyperthyroidism. And so I couldn't really train that much because I was tired all the time and I didn't know why. When I got back, eventually, it's, I was like, my heart was like pounding and I was like sweating like crazy. And I said to my dad, something's wrong. We need to go to the ER. This is after coming back from Taiwan. And so he took me and the ER doc, I mean, like literally came into the room, looked at me like this. I mean, no more. He just looked at me and he said, you have Graves' disease. Just by looking, you can tell. And he was right. So I was not in the greatest energy level, but I still, I learned a lot. I saw a lot of interesting things. I saw Chinese shamanism. I saw Chinese demonic possession. What happens when you train to be a shaman and it goes off, because they brought someone in to this master who had trained to, was training to be a medium in the traditional Chinese way. And somehow it's taken over. So he was possessed. And I saw my teacher, I'm laying in my room. I had my own room. And all of a sudden I hear all of this yelling and cursing in Taiwanese. I thought people were breaking into the temple or something. And so I opened the door and it was my teacher exercising this. And so of course, every culture is culture, right? Which makes us realize that some of these phenomena are very much culture specific, right? So first of all, Chinese shamans write. Every other shaman in every place in the world, the gods speak through you, right? But because China is such a written culture, they write in sand. It's amazing to watch this happening. And the other thing is when they get possessed by demons. Okay, so I guess in our culture, probably it's the Hollywood version now, because people see it in the movies. I don't know what it was in the Catholic church for real, but you got the Hollywood version now. People probably think that's demonic possession. But when it happens in a Chinese context, at least from my observation, what happens is that the person possessed makes these stereotype gestures that are very reminiscent of Chinese opera. Because the Chinese word for a medium is Wu. And the Chinese word for dance is Wu. And a different word for is martial arts, which is also except they're probably all linked originally, right? Because you're sort of in this. So this person was making these walking, that distinctive way they walk in Chinese opera, with their heel down. And he was doing all these sort of hieratic gestures and whatever. My teacher was pointing the finger and yelling the demon out of this person. It was pretty interesting. A white boy from LA doesn't see every day. No kidding. So it was culturally nice, and it was fun to be able to talk to him about advanced topics, but I actually was not in very good health, and didn't even realize it until afterwards. But in any event, I got back and I got the thyroid treated. And then I moved into Thich Nhat Hanh's place, and I was doing this teaching or whatever. And then the teaching just evolved. I see. Now let me ask you something specifically relating to all of this, which is, you've come from this intensive training at Mount Koya in Japan, and then you've come back, you've reconnected with Dr. Thien An and what now is the IBMC there. You go to Taiwan, you spend time with this master, you come back again. You mentioned this kind of core group of people who wanted some more intensive, formal instruction in meditation. And you being essentially one of them, you're a Caucasian Western, grew up in LA guy, but you've had these very rare sorts of opportunities and experiences and this really intensive sort of training. How would you describe the take that these other students had regarding you specifically? What do you think their expectations were regarding you, a Westerner, but also technically in their eyes, perhaps, a monk or at least a trained in Asia person? We know that you're fluent in the languages and you've had this immersion in the culture. How would you describe what you might think of as being their ideas about you at that point? To be honest, I never really thought much about that. I was always a results guy. It's like they have a question, how good of an answer can I give? That's just been the only thing I've ever been interested in or aware of. Honestly, I'm not really sure how to answer that. I know that I always enjoyed answering the questions. It was an interesting challenge. I started almost 50 years ago. If a student calls me today, I'll still learn something new. It's interesting every day for five decades, something new to learn, some subtleties, some insights, some more parsimonious or symmetrical way to structure things. It's always been like a chess game. It's a game. Some people, their whole life centers around playing chess. You can learn about that by seeing that movie In Search of Bobby Fischer. Even if you don't play chess, you can see how people center their life around chess. It's a game, but it becomes sort of what they live for. Well, there's this game that I've been playing for almost 50 years. It's a game, meaning it's fun. I get better and better and better at it, almost on a daily basis, a palpable daily basis. My opponent in this game that I strategize against and that I'm able more and more to defeat, the opponent is not any other person or a person that disagrees or has a different paradigm. The opponent is the breakdown in communication between human beings. That's my enemy. I get to whoop ass on that enemy better and better and better, but it's good for everyone because who wants breakdown in communication? That's bad for humans. It's fascinating to me to analyze over and over and over again what worked and what didn't work in communication and to hone it. Now I'm like a grandmaster of this particular game. I see 12 moves ahead. The student opens their mouth. Half the time, I know what they're going to say before they even... The first three words, I see the whole chessboard. That's always where it's been for me. My motto is, teacher is as student does. It's all about results for the student. For the teacher, it's how much fun can you have getting good at this? Well, you were still pretty young when you started this teaching journey. So when you were... Yeah, I found an old picture. Do you want pictures for this, photos? Or is this oral only? We won't really need photos. Okay. I found a picture of me back in those... Or someone sent me a couple days ago. I can't believe I had all that hair. So how old were you around when you started the IBMC teaching? Well, this is where I get fuzzy. I do remember that I was ordained at the age of 25 as a Buddhist monk. And it's going to be... And then I had three years. And then I'm maybe a little bit off in the sequencing. But I'm going to say late 20s. Yeah, that's what I figured. Something like that. And now I'm getting near the mid-70s. Not quite, but getting there. So during that time at the IBMC when you began teaching, how much awareness did you have of other practice centers or other traditions that were... Quite a bit, because it was international. So it all came through. It was wonderful. And it was in the Buddhist ghetto. That's what we used to call it. You've heard this term? No, but it makes total sense. It's still a Buddhist ghetto over there. It was where the cheap buildings were in between Koreatown and little El Salvador, that Vermont, New Hampshire, Olympic, that part of LA is what we call the Buddhist ghetto, because you had the IBMC, International Buddhist Meditation Center, where I was. Right. You had ZCLA, the Zen Center of LA. It was just a few blocks down on Normandy. Right. Then also in that area was Dalmasa. Dalma is the Korean pronunciation of Dharma, as in Bodhidharma. Sa means a temple, like Ji in Japanese, Sa in Korean. Dalmasa was Sun Sanim's place. Sun Sanim was the master Sung San, but often just known by the honorific Sun Sa, which means just... Actually, that just means a Zen teacher in Korean. Right. He had a lot of students, and his students are now teaching all over the place. His center was there, and a lot of other stuff was not too far away. We had a lot of connections. It was really great. And ultimately, Dr. Tian An got involved in helping the Vietnamese refugee population. Yeah, that was pretty amazing. Opened the Chua Vietnam Temple right nearby too. That's correct. That was after the... You could either call it the fall of Saigon or the liberation of Ho Chi Minh City. It was depending on how you want to look at it. Oh my God, do I remember that. We were right in the middle of that. Well, what do you remember about that? In particular, how did that affect Dr. Tian An's ability to, in a sense, minister to both of these communities, which were so different and seemed to have such different missions attached to them? Well, I don't think they had any difficulty because, after all, first of all, he was familiar with both cultures by this time. Secondly, there was a raft of Buddhist monks that came over. That's why they could open the Chua Vietnam and all those other places. Man Yac, who was his friend, Thich Man Yac, came over, and so did a lot of other people, and a lot of young monks and nuns, a lot of intelligent, young, ordained Buddhist ministers came over. They had plenty of help. I don't think that there was a difficulty in that regard. But what had happened was that I was living there, and there were a lot of other people living there. Most of us were born in the U.S. He did have one senior Afro-American student, one black guy, Suhita. He's passed away, but there was at least one Afro-American. The others were mostly Caucasian of different ilks. We were living there, and we learned some of the\u2014well, most of the people learned, if they were interested, if they ordained under Tienan, they learned some of the Vietnamese stuff. But I knew all the Vietnamese stuff. First of all, I had taken the Vietnamese language. The thing is that just as English is loaded with Latin from a lot of sources, directly from Latin, or through Norman French, or through modern French, or through Spanish, there's a lot of words in English that are of Romance origin, of Latin origin. Well, Vietnamese is highly Sinified. Their technical vocabulary and much of their cultural vocabulary is in fact in the Sino-Vietnamese. It was all written in Chinese characters at one point and pronounced in the Vietnamese way. Vietnamese is a tonal language, like Mandarin or Cantonese. But if you know the pronunciation of the characters in Mandarin, you can make a pretty good guess how they're pronounced in Sino-Vietnamese, even up to tone, which is pretty amazing. So, early on, I figured out how to make that transfer. So, it meant that my rather large vocabulary in Chinese now immediately became a Vietnamese vocabulary, like instantly overnight. So, I'm taking elementary Vietnamese, we're supposed to write an essay on something or other, and I'm able to, I can figure out how to say thyroid hormone in Vietnamese. I just think it in Chinese and then translate it. I might look it up to confirm, but I usually was pretty close. So, he's reading this essay, he's like, how, you just started learning, how could you possibly possibly know all these words? Well, I didn't, I knew them in Chinese, but then I figured out the rather simple phonological transforms I needed to do to turn basically my Chinese vocabulary into Vietnamese. So, I and a few others took it upon ourselves to really learn the Vietnamese liturgy, which is the Chinese liturgy. So, anyway, when the Vietnam War ended, so we're watching on television, we're watching these people, you probably remember this, like struggling to get on helicopters in the US embassy, hanging from helicopters, because if they stick around, it's not going to be very pretty, because they were associated with the American invaders or whatever, they're Catholic or whatever, for whatever reason. So, we're watching that, and you may remember that they sent the people that made it out to different refugee camps in the US, run by the Marines. And Camp Pendleton down in the San Diego area was one of those places. So, I was very impressed by the Marines. Literally in one night, they had contracted with Tianan to have a Buddhist chaplaincy, literally waiting for those people at the base when they arrived. So, they set up these tents. I don't know where they found them, but they found some Buddha statues and they found some candles or whatever. Now, the Catholic stuff, half the refugees were Catholic, the other half were Buddhists, roughly. So, the Catholic stuff's easy enough to take care of, you just find a Catholic priest. But they set up for Buddhists, because they knew what was coming. They had these tents and they had Buddha statues and things, literally overnight. And so, the next morning, they bussed us in. We're all in our Vietnamese robes with Dr. Tianan. And we're going to be Buddhist chaplains for a few days, and then some people did it for longer. But a bunch of us were there for the first few days as the refugees were coming in. And it was an amazing emotional experience, because you're seeing these busloads of people coming into the base, and you're in a bus coming into the base, and you're a non-Asian person in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist robes. And these are the people that were hanging from those helicopters last night. They're here now. And they're seeing you, which is not what they would have in their remotest whatever expected, to like, here I am on the US military base. And there are Vietnamese style Buddhist clergy here, except they're native born Americans. So, in Japanese, they have this expression, to meet the Buddha in hell. And they were looking at us like they were meeting the Buddha in hell. Wow. Yeah, that was quite a thing. So, it was that. That was definitely part of his history. What else? Well, things ultimately sort of changed at the IBMC, and certainly when Dr. Tianan passed away, sounds like there was a fair amount of upheaval. I don't remember upheaval. I don't remember too well, but I'm pretty sure that Karuna just took over. She was... I guess I'm thinking of the University of Oriental Studies more. Oh, that came later. Yeah, that was... I'd forgotten all about that until you... Wow, that's right. There was that little kerfuffle. Yeah, that's right. But Reverend Karuna Dharma took over. Yeah, and she was fine. And I certainly liked her. Everything worked out from my perspective. Yeah, there was a conflict between... What was his name? Leo Kuhn. Yeah. How do you know this? It's my job. Yeah, poor Leo. What an unfortunate figure. Yeah, but that was later. That was a few years later. That wasn't immediately after his passing. So, at some point you opened your own center. Yeah. So how did that come about and when was that? It just was a natural evolution. I was getting more and more students. Shelly and I were together. We were probably married by this time. We were only married for a short time. We didn't even have to get divorced. We just got a summary dissolution because we had what's called an open marriage. So she had boyfriends and that was an agreement, but it turned out it doesn't really work. It's weird. And so we just decided to change the legality. Our relationship didn't really change. So she was someone you met at the IBMC? Yeah, she was. So one of the things that happened at IBMC was that I started a relationship with Sasaki Roshi's organization as an interpreter. And Shelly had practiced on Mount Humpaldy. Yeah. So she knew me as an interpreter and she was living at IBMC, so she knew me as a teacher. That's how we met. Now, the way that my relationship with Sasaki Roshi came about was that I'd had a quasi-girlfriend. Do you mind that I'm listening? No, not at all. The whole world is going to be listening. This goes on the internet, so it's not exactly confidential. No, I just wanted to say I'm your\u2014 Yeah. She called herself Whispering Star, and she was actually gorgeous. And so I'm going to say that was a quasi-girlfriend, more than a friend, less than a whatever. But that was another thing. Well, you know, there was a lot of that kind of swinging going on. So actually, she was technically married to a very good friend of mine, Willard Johnson, who was\u2014 probably still is. I haven't talked to him for years. He was also from the University of Wisconsin, except he actually got his degree and became a professor. So anyway, there was a lot of sharing going on, as you can tell. So anyway, then she had another boyfriend who was studying at \u2014 with Sasaki Roshi. And one day, they didn't have an interpreter. And I guess that boyfriend knew through Star that I spoke Japanese and I was familiar with the special kind of Japanese you need to translate for a Japanese master. So they asked me if I would be an interpreter for him. And so I said yes, and I did, and then I did more, and then I did more for a long, long time, 30 years or something. And that had a big impact in a lot of different ways on my practice. That's also how I met someone that's pretty famous worldwide, which is Leonard Cohen. We shared that teacher, and therefore we had a connection. I put some things up on the internet about things that his fans would be interested in knowing, good stuff that they'd be interested in knowing about him in relationship to his Buddhist practice. Leonard, that is. But yeah, that was a thing. Then there was a kind of crazy thing that happened where I got quasi-initiated into the criminal lifestyle, which we can talk about if you want. But how's our time? Our time is okay. We have another 18 minutes or so, if that's okay. Is that what we want to? We can go longer. We can do whatever is comfortable for you. But if we do 18 minutes, that would be a wrap for you? That would be enough? We'll see what happens in 18 minutes. Okay, because there's a lot more to tell. Oh, of course. Well, let's get what we can get comfortably. Yeah. So one thing that I haven't talked about, which is pretty important, is about four years after my ordination, so that would be about a year after I'd returned to the United States, something happened and it was sudden and dramatic, and it continues to influence me to this day and is pretty much the basis from which I teach. So I was teaching before this happened, but after this happened, it was very, very different. So my very first meditation teacher was Okamura Sensei, who I think I've talked about. He was a professor of German philosophy, of all things, at Koyasan University. So he was a Shingon monk, but he was also a Zen practitioner. And when I left Japan, I asked him for a sort of homework assignment, and he said, answer this question, who are you? Which is a self-inquiry thing. It's done in Hindu context and in various ways in the Buddhist context, including Zen. So I asked, how am I going to answer that question? I knew it wasn't an intellectual question, like, I'm going to give you an answer. It was an experiential invitation to focus in a certain way. So it's like, well, how do I answer this question? And he said, well, turn the light back on itself. Well, what does that mean? Well, go back to the source of the river. What does that mean? And then he said a few other equally inscrutable things. Be aware of awareness itself, or whatever. So that's the problem with the self-inquiry way of working, if you want to call it a problem. It's pretty hard to put into words what you're being asked to do. And whatever you bring to the teacher, they're going to say the same thing. Who sees that? Who hears that? Who feels that? Who thinks that? Who says that? So you're always, you might characterize it as turned back. I've recently, in the last couple of years, figured out a way to fit that approach into my grid of techniques. It took me decades, but I finally integrated it into the ultra menu. I have this, I don't know if we ever discussed it, but I've got this really elegant, symmetric, comprehensive ontology of all the meditation techniques of the world. Ontology meaning a taxonomy with an emphasis on clarifying relationships between the taxa. I love that. It's from information science, not ontology in the philosophical sense. So I've got this comprehensive ontology of meditation techniques. And for years I couldn't quite figure out where to put self-inquiry on this sort of systematic grid, but then I finally figured out how to do it in a really elegant, simple way. But anyway, that's one of the things that I've spent decades and decades developing, which is taking all the fundamental elements of contemplative practice and creating ontologies for them. Okay, here's what meditation is, here's the dimensional analysis, here's the goals of meditation, here's the dimensional analysis of that, here's the techniques, here's the relationship between the techniques and the goals and the nature of meditation experience. That's what I've spent most of my life doing. Anyway, so although I had done Shingon practice, which centers around what's called deity yoga, which is one way of working. You hold a certain mental image, you hold a certain mantra, you hold certain body experiences facilitated by mudras, and you merge with an archetype by doing that. So that was the practice, that's how I would characterize the practice of Shingon. Tibetan practice entails that, plus all that fancy physical yoga, Hatha yoga things that I mentioned. So you could characterize Tibetan practice as having two secrets, because sometimes that, I mentioned that Vajrayana in East Asia is called Midsong or Mikyo in Japanese, it means secret teaching. So Tibetan practice is a little later historically, or has been influenced by a later strata of Vajrayana than Shingon. So you've got two secrets in Tibetan secret Buddhism, just one in Shingon. So the secret in Shingon, which I'm telling you, is you use visualization, mantra, and body experience facilitated by mudra to link your image, talk, and emotional body with that of an archetype. And that actually gives you insight into the arbitrary nature of self-identification, which is the liberating wisdom, but at the same time allows you to carry this archetype and sort of channel the energy of that into the world as you walk through the world to sort of benefit the world. And so it's wisdom and compassion both. So that's the first secret. It's called deity yoga, Samyutsu Kaji in Japanese. But then what Tibet has that Japan doesn't is the second secret, which is how to do all these esoteric physical yoga, things that alter your physiology, or how to use natural alterations of physiology, like what happens in sleep or sex, how to use that to get the realization of emptiness down into a cellular, down right into your physiology. So the ceremonies as done in Tibet have two parts. There's the kye rim, which is where you use the first secret, body, speech, mind, or image, talk, feel. And then there's the dzog rim, where you dissolve everything back into the void at a physiological level. Now in Shingon, they have the two parts also, but the second part doesn't involve any special yoga. It just involves going back into emptiness. So that got really elaborated in Tibet. But self-inquiry or asking who sees, who hears, who feels is a different way to work that can bring about the same insights and liberation. So you can visualize and mantra- you can visualize yourself as a deity, mantra-fy your own mental talk space, and hold the physical and emotional sensations of an archetype through hieratic mudras, and that will lead you into a liberating insight. Or you can just observe the see, hear, feel, and that's the mindfulness way. Well, mindfulness in the small sense of observing. Or instead of pouring your attention into what you see, hear, feel, which is to penetrate it with satipatthana, you can try to turn 180 degrees back. Every time you see, hear, feel anything, instead of pouring your attention down the arrow, you try to look past the nock end of the arrow to the pure consciousness that's behind. So I had done the Shingon practice, but my teacher gave me a Zen homework assignment, okay, which was this turn back, or who am I? So it's a kind of groping with attention, back, back, back. So that had been the assignment. And I did that, and I continued to do that. When I came back to the US, I was constantly pushing back, pushing back, pushing back, pushing back. And then I was at my parents' apartment, and I'd been alone. I think they were off at Gilman Hot Springs. They had a house there on a golf course, because they were into that kind of thing. And I was alone. I'd been just reading and doing stuff all day. And I realized that, oh, I haven't done any meditation today. I think it was a Saturday, and it was getting late in the day. And so I got out my Zafu, the meditation cushion, and put it down. And I sat down, and the instant that my body hit the cushion, the question, who am I, was there. And the way I'd been going about doing that questioning was, well, I'm constantly pushing back, pushing back. What's behind? What's behind? What's behind? Because as I said, it's not an intellectual question. It's a way of directing your attention towards something. So I sat down, I directed my attention towards that, and it just went out. And the boundaries disappeared, and they never came back. And it was so stunning that I actually leapt up from my seat. And I just started to walk around the room, just looking at the walls, just looking at everything. And it's like there was just no barrier. There was no separation. It didn't matter that I was moving, I wasn't doing any technique or whatever. It was just there. And then this... we can talk over it, right? I had this sort of negative thought came up, except the thought wasn't localized in me. It was just as much in the wall as it was in me. And then the wall laughed at me for having this thought. Is that mine? I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. And so there was just this magic thing. So I just sat down and turned on the television. And I was just like watching cartoons, and it didn't make any difference. I didn't have to be meditating or doing any particular this or that. It was just as much there, just sort of watching TV as any place else. And so I remember thinking, okay, this is going to be like everything else. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and I'm going to be back to square one, right? Except it didn't work that way. I woke up the next day and it was the same, and then it was the same, and it was the same, and it was never not that from that time on. And so I just spent like two weeks just walking around the block all day, every day, and just thinking about this and exploring it. So I knew that there was a tradition. If you've had this kind of experience, you're supposed to get it, quote, validated by a Zen master. And the only real, according to Hoyle, Zen master that I knew at the time, this is before I met Sasaki Roshi, I tangentially had had some connections with Mayuzumi Roshi. I didn't know him well. But we talked a bit every now and again, because, hey, Buddhist ghetto, right? Yeah, exactly. So I actually called him up and said, something happened, I'd like to talk to you about it. And usually with these Zen masters, no matter what you say, they sort of say, you're full of shit, and get you out of the room. I didn't even really know this person that well. So I suspected he was just going to say, hey, kid, you're full of shit, get out of here. But I knew myself that something had happened. It doesn't matter what he says. But no, he did not say that at all. In fact, he said sort of the opposite of that, which is, yeah, this is pretty much what we're talking about. And it's going to grow, and good, good for you. And then I said, well, can I tell people about it? He said, well, if you think that it's going to encourage them, yeah. And he said some other things, I can't remember, but it was very spot on and relevant to my situation. So things have never been the same since then. Now, these are the kinds of stories that you read about, like in the Three Pillars of Zen, sort of sudden, dramatic things. And it does happen, and it happens to my students. It happens to people that are in my program every now and again. It's pretty cool when it happens. But it's been my experience that most of the people that have come to that through my programs, it didn't happen sudden like that. It mostly seems to happen gradually, at least in my experience with my students. It just sort of gradually comes on, and they acclimatize to it, and they don't quite realize how enlightened they've become. So even though the books say it's supposed to happen this way, my field experience, I don't think it's quite as acclimatized as it is. My field experience is actually not that, but my own experience was that. It's just like one of those stories in the Three Pillars of Zen kind of thing. So I don't necessarily dangle that kind of sudden, dramatic breakthrough as a goal for the practice. I see it taking both forms. But whether it's sudden or gradual, it certainly is a feasible goal. How about you, Ann? Did you ever have one of those sudden things, or was it more just gradual? I've had sudden, oh my God. And then I've had slowly, when you're teaching, going into this still point of the turning world where everything stops. So when was your first sudden, did you have an initial sudden one that changed you forever in a dramatic way? Yes. When did that happen? When I opened up that book, Zen Flesh and Bones, and it said I could instantly be perfect. In that moment, I just had a flash. This is it. I found what I was looking for in a bookstore. It just came over me like a big, I found it. And then, were you in a sort of wonderland after that for a while? Yes. Oh, still can go to that wonderland. Yeah. So it happens. That was the first book for me, by the way. Really? Yeah. So maybe this is a good break point. Maybe. I just did want to ask you one thing. Yeah, sure. What about the ethical dimension of Buddhist practice in relation to, in particular, some of the things that you said were kind of characterizing the activities of the residents at places like the IBMC? And you mentioned some kind of brush with criminal behavior. How much of the ethical dimension of practice in the form of, say, precepts or whatever, was entering into the picture with the people practicing and learning meditation at that time? Well, I would say for myself at that time, I can't speak for others, but for myself at that time, I was more interested in liberation than in being a good person. Yeah, conduct. Yeah. That's more or less going through a 180-degree shift between then and now. Now, if someone asks me, what's the center of your practice? It's, well, trying to do the right thing and not fuck up too much is pretty much what I think about every day. The liberation piece is only, well, how well can I describe this that might be helpful to people. In terms of the centerpiece, the schwerpunkt, or sort of center of gravity of my own practice, it's all now about just get my shit together and be an admirable person. But back then, it was about becoming free, and I didn't really care very much what other people did in terms of ethics. I made my money by selling dope, et cetera. Okay. So with this breakthrough experience that you had, was that affected or not affected by, say, smoking dope? At that time, it did not have a strong ethical dimension to it. But your priorities evolve with time. And maybe because I didn't have that dimension early on is why I emphasize it strongly now. Mm-hmm. How was this, for example, smoking weed affecting or not affecting this? Well, I smoked marijuana all day, every day for 10 years while I was there. So that makes you a stoner, and it makes you tired all day, and it has health consequences. But then I went off and did a Goenka retreat for 10 days. Oh. And they require that you not use anything like that. And my thing is always follow the rules. People ask me, like, oh, I'm going to so-and-so's retreat. How should I meditate? I tell them, like, that person says to meditate, don't ask me, because you always want to give it a fair chance, right? I would never encourage someone to use my techniques at someone else's retreat unless the teacher says, yeah, go ahead and do it, right? You always want to give it a fair trial. So their thing is, well, you can't use anything like that. So, okay, that's the thing. So for 10 days, I didn't use it. Then I was doing their technique, which is the body sweeping technique. Right. And I was sweeping through the body, and I noticed some very mild congestion in my chest area. And that was just once, just once while I was sweeping through, and it wasn't a very strong sensation. But I remember thinking, oh yeah, that must be because I put a lot of smoke down there, right? And I didn't give it any further thought, just kept doing the technique, and it's really great because all this energy dissolving into subtle vibration that tends to happen with that technique did happen. I was already an experienced meditator when I did my first retreat in that tradition. So it's over, I go back, and it's like, I don't feel like doing any grass today. And then it's the next day, and I'm like, yeah, I just don't feel like doing it. And it's another day like that. And at some point I realized, wow, this is over for me. And there was no on the wagon, off the wagon, on the wagon, off the wagon decisions or struggle. The paradigm in the Upakin tradition is that body sensations are the most primitive thing next to the subconscious consciousness itself. So your samskaras or your habit forces can be impacted through how you work with body sensations. Now, it's also true that you can reach some of those deep levels through archetypal imagery. That's what you do in Vajrayana practice, for example. But in retrospect, when I look back, my interpretation is that without me knowing about it consciously, apparently the part of my body that was enjoying getting high and the part of my body that was not enjoying being damaged, communicated to each other below the threshold of awareness and came to a decision that was an effortless behavior change. Now, sometimes behavior changes associated with this path happen that way. It just happens. You meditate and you're different. And there wasn't much conscious or anything conscious involved. The circuits just rewired themselves due to the practice. On the other hand, some behavior changes for me have been long struggles that took years and years and required psychotherapy and all sorts of meditation strategies that didn't work, but then eventually did. So some behavior changes, you said about shila, which means character, even though it's translated precept, it's not really precept, it's character, it's how you carry yourself in the world. So behavior change is one of the dimensions of happiness in my ontology of why we do this practice, which is to be happy as broadly and as deeply as any human being can be happy. So some behavior changes happen without any effort at all as the result of meditation. And some may require that you see a cognitive behavioral therapist for 18 months in order for the changes to take place, or you have a 12-step, or you have a 12-step, you're in the 12-step program for your life with a sponsor in order for the changes to take place. So I've had the whole range. The thing with dope was pretty dramatic. That was effortless and sudden and below the threshold. On the other hand, the thing with procrastination, I struggled with that my whole life, but it has gotten better as time goes on. So yeah, I was mostly interested in deepening the liberation side of the practice. And I'm just curious to know though, you had this breakthrough experience, but how did the effect of the weed interact or relate to that or not? Well, the breakthrough did not stop me from smoking weed. Okay. And did it in any way affect your perception of reality? No, that particular habit... What's the subject of the sentence? Did the breakthrough affect reality or the weed? Did the intoxication, the effect of the weed have any sort of impact on your breakthrough experience, your change in perception that you were experiencing from that time on? What kind of relationship did they have? The breakthrough was not dependent on the weed, but what marijuana can do is it can slow down time and it can make you very sensitive to subtle sensory experiences. So from that perspective, it actually can make it easier to meditate. But then that becomes a bad thing if you start to always want to use that. Yes, depend on it. Depend on it, which is exactly what happened in my case. It just made it interesting. That's for sure. But I think I'd be a lot healthier now if I hadn't smoked marijuana for 10 years. Yeah. Well. But you have to learn eventually. And here you are. Okay. Does that do it for you or for now? Okay. I would say all in all, it's not been too bad. But next time I should tell you about how I met lifestyle criminals. Something people don't expect to be hearing about in these sorts of interviews. Yeah. It was pretty out there because my thing was always an interest in esoteric cultures. So it started with Japan, which was a very esoteric interest in the 1950s for a non-Asian person. Forget about it. It was not cool. It was not a thing that was a cool thing to look into. And then that extended to an interest in China that then extended to an interest in India. So I've always been interested in the esoteric cultures. So when I was at IBMC, I get this telephone call. And on the other end is this person who says, My name is Lee Wino. And many people would consider me to be quite dangerous, but we have a friend in common. And the friend in common was the publisher of Black Belt Magazine, which was the first English language martial arts magazine ever. I remember when it came out, I got the first edition of it because I was like, wow, I can't believe that the general public's interested in this stuff now. I'd been interested in high school, my friend and I. We had pursued karate and so forth. But because of that, I knew the guy that was publishing Black Belt Magazine, and so did Wino. So he used that name to introduce himself. And he said, we have this friend in common, I can't remember the fellow's name. And he said that we might understand each other. And the reason he knew the publisher of Black Belt Magazine was that they were going to do a story about him because he started the first martial arts class in a Mexican prison where he was an inmate, Amarillo State Prison. They caught him with a truck full of marijuana at the border. But he was also in San Quentin, he was in a lot of places. But he had that martial arts connection. And so he said, a lot of people would consider me to be a dangerous person, but I think you and I, this mutual friend of ours says that we understand each other. And he had this way of talking that was both charming and threatening at the same time. And had these built-in ambiguities that just kept you constantly a little off balance. So I thought that he was organized crime. He said, I'd like to come and visit you. I live in Hollywood, you're in Koreatown, can I come by? And I said, sure. And I had in my mind, there's going to be a black Cadillac with a mafioso type person. So I'm waiting in the front of the IBMC sitting out on the lawn, this person's going to come. And I hear way at the distance, the loudest fucking motorcycle that I'd ever heard in my life. They take the mufflers off to make an impression. And it's like miles away, I can hear this thing, right? It was getting closer and closer. And sure enough, it pulls up right in front of IBMC, this badass looking guy on this badass looking motorcycle. He's all encased in leather and he's got brass knuckles here. And he's wearing this hat that's like a coonskin hat, except it has an entire taxidermically mounted fox on the top of it looking at you. And he's got silver glasses, you can't see his eyes. Yeah, mirror glasses. And he gets off this bike and he moves towards me in this sort of articulated way. And I'm thinking, this isn't a human, it's a giant fucking insect. This huge insect is like coming at me, right? And so he sits down, he takes off his glasses, looks me straight in the eye, and I see that he's seen the no self. If you're in the field, you know what to look for. And it's like there's an outlaw biker that understands that. That was a very strange juxtaposition. Turns out he had decided early in life that he wanted to be, quote, an outlaw. So that's a one percenter biker, the one percent of the biking population that has a professional criminal lifestyle. So like the Hells Angels or the Satan Slaves or the Mongols, or these different groups, right? They call themselves one percenter. There's even a TV show about them. Did you ever see the Sons of Anarchy? No, I've heard of it. Well, I mean, it's a TV show, so it's ridiculously over the top, right? But they do nail a lot of what that culture is about, actually. And part of that is because Sonny Barger, who was the president of the Oakland branch of the Hells Angels, is a consultant on that Sons of Anarchy show and actually appears as an actor in the show. Now, Wino knew Sonny Barger, had run with him, and his best friend had been the president of the LA branch of the Hells Angels. So this is definitely one percenter club. His club was the Righteous Bastards. That was the name of his club. And they were the only club that claimed Hollywood as their turf. So anyway, he had decided early in life that he wanted to be an outlaw and that the consequence of that would be long periods of incarceration. So he decided to, as he put it, run amok when he's not incarcerated and then use the incarceration periods to better himself through academic study and meditation practice. So he had done formal meditation in San Quentin. And see, the way these prisons work is there's a lot of people in them. So if you have a lot of people, it means you have a high probability that there are intelligent and well-educated people. So those people usually get put to work in the library. So that's what he did. He would try to get a job in the library or cultivate, because he only had an eighth grade education. But he had a graduate school vocabulary because he would cultivate friendships with well-educated, intelligent inmates. One of them was the Birdman of Alcatraz. And the other one was, I think one of the people arrested with the, was it the Rosenbergs or something like that, anyway, Sobel, something like that. So yeah, he could talk like a graduate student and he'd had really deep experiences with Buddhist practice. And he still has an outlaw lifestyle. That to me was pretty weird. And when is a guy like me ever going to be able to talk to a guy like that? Well, only if there's this rare situation where there's something about what I do that he's interested in, and there's something about him that I can see makes him different, right? So we did understand each other, actually. And for a couple years, I hung out. And even though he said he was dangerous, I wouldn't say he actually himself was all that dangerous. He was pretty mellow, really. His friends, on the other hand, that's a very, very different story. The kinds of people he hung out with were definitely dangerous and very scary. And I got to see what those kinds of people are like, close up. And so that was another cultural adventure for me. Okay.
