{"text": " Okay? Yeah. All right, it's working. Today is July 5th, 2018. This is Alex Cline interviewing Shinzen Young once again in the lovely home of Mrs. Ann Buck, and this is session number five. Good morning again. Good morning. We left off six months ago with your very colorful telling of your meeting with Lee Wino and your encounter with his colleagues, shall we say, people in what we would refer to as the criminal element, largely, which you viewed as kind of another culture of interest for study. And you had mentioned that, for example, you were selling weed to make money, and this relationship, I guess, proved to be rather fortuitous in that regard. But one of the other things you mentioned in connection with Lee Wino, which also you mentioned in connection with your math tutor, whose name I believe was Tony. Correct. Was this merging technique, and it sounded like you were headed towards describing perhaps a merging experience with Lee Wino. Was that something that happened? Yes. Now, merging is one facet of meditative experience, and there are actually a number of mechanisms whereby that can be achieved, what you might refer to them as strategies, how to use your meditative skill, your basic attentional skills, concentration, clarity, equanimity, how to use those skills to have an experience of oneness with something else. So one dimension to consider is the different ways in which that can happen, or different meditative strategies or focus strategies for that to happen. Other dimensions to consider are that we can distinguish contemplative or meditation-based merging from other kinds of merging that may take place. For example, there's a merging that takes place for most people during sexual encounters, and there's a merging that can take place associated with a weak sense of self. It's a psychopathology, right? Like a borderline situation or lacking boundaries in a way that is not adaptive, it's not useful for life, and psychologists have to try to ameliorate or cure people that have those weak boundary problems. That's a pathological merging. Then not entirely unrelated to that is our phenomena like identification with the aggressor, the Patty Hearst Stockholm Syndrome kind of thing. That's another pathological merging, or a merging that is typically not in the service of life. So we have to distinguish what characterizes contemplative merging or meditation-based merging from these other kinds of merging. That could be a long conversation which we won't go into because you want my history, not my paradigms. But I would say for anyone listening to this, they should know that there are these dimensions. The main difference between contemplative merging and these other ones is that contemplative merging is something you do consciously and in a controlled way. The other ones sort of happen to you. The other ones meaning sexual situations or other kinds of identifications that may take place due to weak boundary or to being in a sense victimized by someone and so forth. So the contemplative one is under control. It's intentional and it's in the service of life. It's adaptive. It's useful for things. Now there's an interesting thing because sometimes when I bring up this topic, people think that merging with another person in a contemplative way sounds invasive, like, well, shouldn't you ask permission? But it's not. You don't have to ask permission because it's not you're going inside them, it's you're letting them inside you, which is basically equivalent to unconditional love. I don't think you really have to ask permission to radiate that out into the world. So that's another little area where people get tripped up. So another thing is within contemplative merging, it can be done for one of two goals. One of those goals is important and the other is less important. I'll explain what I mean by that. So there's a variety of strategies and there's two basic reasons you might do it. One is generic. It leads to all the good things that meditation is supposed to bring, meaning purification of your own consciousness, insight into the nature of how consciousness works, and a loving relationship to the outside world. Those are generic, healthy goals. But then you can merge with another person for a specific goal, which is to get something from that merging for yourself. Now what you might get for yourself is some specific attribute that that person has that you want to metabolize into yourself. Or what you might get for yourself is an establishing of a rapport, which you then use to manipulate the other person and to prevent them from manipulating you. Now that kind of merging is encouraged in certain self-improvement programs, specifically NLP, neuro-linguistic programming. It gives you what I would consider to be essentially meditative techniques for merging with others. And although they may give lip service to all sorts of good things, universally good things, the subtext is, if you know how to do this, it's going to give you an advantage in the zero-sum game of life, business, mating, whatever. I think of that as the spiritual equivalent of prostitution. You take something that is meant to be sacred, human sexuality, and now you're debasing it. So this ability to merge that in the generic can lead to generic good things for humans, to wit, purification of your own consciousness, insight into the nature of consciousness, and a sort of unconditional positive regard for all of creation. You take something that's meant to do that, and you take the techniques that are legitimate techniques that can cause merging, but then your sales pitch, either the text or the subtext, is, it's a zero-sum game out there, if you know this, you have an advantage, if you don't, you have a disadvantage. That's the hook. That's prostitution. That is, to me, abhorrent. Now, and maybe it's not for nothing that one of the founders of NLP murdered a prostitute and bragged about getting away with it. And how do I know? Because some of my students were there. So that's where that meets. I'm making a strong statement, probably offending some people, but at my age I don't care. Now sort of in between prostitution and these deep generic spiritual goals comes merging with another person to gain some specific quality that you might use in an ethical way. So I was pretty strongly trained to merge only for the generic good things that I mentioned, but I knew about the other, and the mechanism is identical, or the strategies, how you go about doing it. So the easiest form of merging is when the person is in, let's say it's merging with a person, although you can just as well merge with flowers and garbage cans, whatever, but let's just say it's a person. So if the person is physically present, then you merge by sight and sound, perhaps also touch, depending, right? So that if the inner world of mental image, mental talk, and body motion contract, and the outer world of sight, sound, perhaps also touch, expand, then the identity shifts and you unbecome the inner, and you, there's a figure of reversal, and you say, I am the other. The Yoga Sutras describe this as sabhija samadhi. You can look it up if you're interested. So anyway, that's one way. A more subtle way is you actually merge in the inner system. You think about that person, you get an image, you get mental talk, in other words you see them, you hear their voice, maybe you have some emotional thing. So it's like inner, see, hear, maybe feel. And you so fully focus on that that you become that. And that's a practice that is called Deity Yoga, used a lot in the Vajrayana tradition and so forth. So you can merge to take on qualities of an archetype, or of a person, a living person. So in my memory I've only merged with a person to gain something from them twice, intentionally, because I was taught to do the other kind of merging, and also I was taught that merging to take advantage is like definitely a bad thing. So mostly I did my whole life, ever since I could learn, had enough meditation skills to do this. But the two times I did merge with someone is with Tony in SightSound, as he was manifesting mathematician. I couldn't understand anything he was saying, I gave up on understanding, I just merged and metabolized. The second time is, yes, I merged with Wino. I needed, but that was not done from his physical presence, that was actually done with a memory image, because I needed a certain ability, which was the ability to look like you're at home when you are incarcerated, to look like you're comfortable and belong there. I needed that ability because I found my ass in San Pedro jail. Did I tell you about getting arrested? So I have been arrested, and it wasn't for selling weed either. I never got busted for that. But Brian Victoria and I, Brian has written many books on the sort of shadow side of Japanese Zen. That's what he's famous for. We haven't talked for many years, not for any particular reason, just he's off where he is, I'm where I am. But we were very good friends together in Japan, and we were friends together at IBMC. He lived at IBMC when I lived at IBMC. And then in Japan we did things together. In the States, we did things. So Brian is a Soto Zen monk, and actually in terms of seniority, slightly senior to me in terms of years of practice and such. So when I knew him, I guess I would describe him as a communist, which may seem like an interesting juxtaposition, but that was him. I'm not sure that would be the label he'd use, but he was pretty favorably disposed to Russia under communism and China under Mao as a good model for society. There are extreme left-wing Buddhists even\u2014well, anyway. So that's not my politics, but the Vietnam War was going on and a lot of other bad shit was going on. The farm workers were organizing or had been organizing in California under Cesar Chavez. South Korea still had a horrible human rights and international situation at that time. This is before Kim Dae-jung was elected president. So they were under\u2014and I had lived in South Korea while my passport for Japan ran out. I had to go to South Korea and wait out there and come back in four months, so I went to Korean language school. It was easy to pick up Korean because I knew Chinese and I knew Japanese. The grammar of Korean is rather similar to Japanese, although the phonology is quite different, but the semantics are similar. And of course, a large part of the lexicon is derived from Chinese. So if you know Chinese and you know Japanese, you can pick up Korean very quickly, which I did. But it was sort of interesting because when I first moved to Korea, I couldn't have many conversations with people unless they happened to either speak English or Japanese. So I wasn't like day-to-day conversations with just the person in the street in South Korea. By the time I left, I could do that. It was a real eye-opener for me because I'd never lived in a totalitarian state. I lived in Japan, which is now a modern democracy, of course, U.S. modern democracy. I never lived in a country where the government controls all the information. Now in all fairness, relative to North Korea, that's Freedom City, okay? But relative to the U.S. or Japan, it's like, oh, this is what totalitarianism is. You would see that their media would manufacture situations that no other media in the world were covering, right? Because they weren't in existence, but the population. So once I could actually speak Korean, I started to get more and more upset at the mindfuck that was going on there. And so I promised myself, okay, someday I'm going to do something. Someday I'm going to do something to flip the bird, basically, to the South Korean government. It was an anger thing, right? I hadn't meditated yet. So anyway, Brian and I were at IBMC, and one of the things we did that I'm really proud of is we actually marched with Cesar Chavez. We had a sign that said, Budistas para justicia, Buddhas for justice. It was pretty cool. So another thing we did is\u2014so do you remember? It wasn't a big thing, but it was a little bit of a thing. It was called Koreagate. Remember that? No, I don't. It was at the bicentennial, so 1776. It's going to be 1976. That's plop in the middle of when I'm at IBMC. So South Korea still had not elected Kim Dae-jung, so that's when the big change took place, when Kim Dae-jung became president of South Korea, democratized. But this is pre-Kim Dae-jung. So they were bribing members of Congress to be favorable to South Korea, and it came out. And they called it Koreagate. Part of Koreagate is that they had allocated probably several million dollars, I'm guessing, to creating what was to be a West Coast analog of the Statue of Liberty, which was called the Korean Freedom Bell. Oh, yeah. It's still there. Yeah, absolutely. Fort MacArthur in San Pedro. Yeah, in San Pedro. Yeah, you've seen it. It's beautiful. I was just there two weeks ago. So I mean it is beautiful, and I'm glad they did it. Now the Koreans have an emotional relationship to large temple bells. They give them personal names, like Suzy or Jane or something like that. So that bell is a copy of Amire. Amire is one of the biggest temple bells, if not the biggest in Korea. And that's its name. That's a personal name. I don't even know what it means, but that's its name in Korean. So they built this life-size model and put it in a pavilion, which is fine, but they called it the Korean Freedom Bell. It was supposed to be, as I say, an East Coast analog to the Statue of Liberty. People come here from Asia, presumably seeking freedom. So for Brian and I, the Korean Freedom Bell sounds a little bit like the All Men Are Brothers monument erected by the Nazi Party or something. It's like oxymoronic. So we decided we were going to interrupt the dedication ceremony. And we lucked out, because the mayor of LA was there. I'm pretty sure it was Bradley at that time. I could be wrong. The mayor of LA was there, and the Korean ambassador from Washington was there. So it was a chance to embarrass South Korea. Now what happened was that\u2014it's actually a longer story, and this branches into something we may want to go into, which is my relationship with a woman named Nicola Geiger. Have we mentioned her yet? No. Well, I've been fortunate to have many teachers. The two biggest influences on me at the very beginning\u2014and the beginning is really important. I had two huge influences on me. Later I had other influences, of course. But the two beginning influences\u2014interestingly enough, one Asian Buddhist, the other European semi-Christian. The Asian Buddhist was Okamura Sensei, who I think I've mentioned, who basically taught me how to meditate. He took me by the hand and said, Hey kid, here's how you do it. But after I'd meditated for a year or so, something like that, I met Nicola. And that's probably\u2014we could put a pin in that, because that's quite a story. Quite a story. But Okamura Keishin basically taught me how to meditate and taught me what to expect from a lifetime of practice. So that's pretty big. But it was mostly from a Zen perspective, which was mostly from the perspective\u2014mostly about the aspect of practice, which we might call liberation. From Nicola, I was indoctrinated into the aspect of practice called service. And we can go into that story at some point. But\u2014and we probably should. But she's passed away, but she was German, from an aristocratic family. She was in her twenties when Hitler came to power. She knew Hitler. She was in the Deutsche Medienpunt. She was in the Hitler Youth for Women. But she was just a kid. They didn't know any better. It's just all about the earth and going back to our Volksgeist, what have you. But she very quickly figured out who they were. And she became part of the German resistance to Hitler when Hitler was in full power. It wasn't just the occupied countries had resisters. There were German nationals who were working against Hitler. There's a movie made about them called The White Rose. Most of them ended up executed. And she came very close to that. The movie, if you saw Schindler's List, all that happened to her in her twenties. I mean, you name it, it happened. And any one of those would be enough to destroy someone. There's another movie called The Pawnbroker about someone who was abused in World War II and ended up frail and basically incapable of living and a curmudgeon. I think it had Ronsteiger. And that's the usual effect of even one experience of torture or abuse or whatever. She had a dozen from both sides, from the Russians, from the Nazis, you name it, from us. She was in the fire bombings. So any one of the things she went through would have a tendency to pretty much destroy a person's ability to live subsequently. But in her it had the exact opposite effect. And why? Because her father had taught her how to meditate. They were associated with the whole League of Journeyers to the East, Hesse, and these people that between the wars in Europe were sort of Christian, sort of Buddhist, blah, blah, blah. They were part of that. So she could meditate. She never remembers a time. She did not have a Buddhist-style sitting meditation practice. So that allowed all that shit to turn to gold. So you would think that someone who had had the experience of being the kind of victim that Amnesty International helps, you would think that they wouldn't themselves want to have to revisit that by working for Amnesty International. But she did. She was their specialist for South Korea. And she was involved in trying to save Kim Dae-jung's life by sneaking into South Korea. It was like fucking spy shit. Dangerous spy shit she was doing in South Korea. They had Kim Dae-jung. They were going to kill him. I think they knew he could be a Democrat. And they were going to kill him. They had him in a boat. And for some reason, the U.S. intervened and wouldn't let them kill him. And eventually he was freed and he was elected president. And she was in that. She was in that mix. So, major political intrigue, sneaking into South Korea when you're on a no-fly list. So anyway, there were a bunch of old South Korean Christians, Presbyterians, Quakers and such living here who basically wanted to replace the government of South Korea with people like them. And so through Nicola, Brian and I met these Korean elders. And we formulated a strategy. We didn't want to put them in harm's way, obviously. So they were outside the ceremonial venue in the town passing out pamphlets in Korean and English about human rights violations in South Korea. They were away from the action. There's nothing illegal about that. And then Brian and I had this sheet rolled up. And at the appropriate moment, when the Korean ambassador started his dedication speech, we unfurled this ginormous thing off to the side, but where everyone could see. And it said, Friendship, Yes. Dictatorship, No. So we had, when they came in, they got this sort of, hey, here's what this government is really like. And then we sort of framed on the parade. And we lucked out because we wanted to create a disruption. And we sure did. Of course, the mayor's there, the ambassador's there, so the Secret Service is there hiding. But as soon as we started to do this shit, they came out. And they and the San Pedro Peace really roughly arrested us and just dragged us off. Of course, we wanted that. I ended up on the ground with a couple of guys in the three-piece suits with the machine guns, you know, whatever, on me. But they were cuffing Brian standing up. So the next day in the LA Times, on the second page, it's a picture of Brian getting handcuffed, huge picture, in front of the, quote, Korean Freedom Bell for, quote, protesting, quote, alleged human rights violations. So we got a lot of publicity out of that. And Brian had done this a gazillion times, so he knew. You come with your bail money. But he didn't bother to share that information with me. So he went in and he went out. And I went in, and it's like, oh, bail money. Okay, well, you guys have to go back to LA and see if you can get some money to get me out of here. So I was actually in jail. And not for long, but still, jail is jail, and a lot can happen in a little time. And it was something that was not on my radar to get in trouble with the law. So I needed to look not like I was some sort of badass, don't mess with me, because that would really get me in trouble. I needed to look like this is not new for me. I've been here so many times, and I'm just another veteran criminal, and I'm just cooling my heels, and no one should be paying any attention to me at all, because I hardly even look like I'm here. So I merged with Wino, because he had that quality. He had survived San Quentin. He had survived Hermosillo State Prison, which is in Mexico. He knew how to look. He knew how to carry himself in an incarcerated situation so as to not attract any problems. So I did, and I didn't attract any problems. And then they came back eventually the same day and got me out. So that's that story. How long did you stay in relationship with Wino? Many years, many years. And we did a lot together. We used to just smoke dope and ride around town. I'd ride on the back of his bike. Did I talk about that experience? No. Well, it was a kind of communication. He felt that the\u2014see, it's an interesting thing when you have\u2014you're very different in some ways, but you have also a basis of a relationship. So we're very different. I mean, he's a professional criminal and I'm not. He's a tough guy. I used to get beat up and picked on in school a lot. So very different. But he's very smart and in a sense well-educated, even though his formal schooling ended in the eighth grade. Because what he decided was\u2014I don't know if we mentioned this before, but he decided early in life he wanted to be an outlaw. And that would entail periods of incarceration. So during incarceration he would meditate, he would read. And prisons have large populations, so that means that statistically there are intelligent, well-educated people. And he sought those people out and interacted with them. So he improved himself mentally and spiritually, basically making incarceration into school and monastery. And then when he was out, he went\u2014so he was very smart to begin with. And although in a sense spotty, in another sense well-educated, he could communicate with graduate school vocabulary, which is pretty good for someone that had very limited formal education. So he was smart and in a sense well-educated. And he had a deep understanding of Buddhist experience. He had just made a decision to express it in a very unusual way, which was fascinating actually that that could even be done. So his thing was that the outlaw bikers are the contemporary American analog of roding, masterless samurai, knights errant. Or like the wuxia in the Chinese, right? And those people actually did exist in the Tang Dynasty. There were these tough guys, and they always\u2014you knew they were because of the weapons they carried and whatever. And they'd go into a bar and be drinking and more or less say, anyone here have any grievances? And then they'd go out and settle the score. That was a whole thing in China. They're called wuxia. And it's not just made up for Chinese movies, because the literature of that time reflects that. But anyway, that's what he modeled himself at. That's what he thought they were. So in those days, well, you fought with swords. And a very small minority of the samurai were trained in Zen to fight from no self. I mean, many talked about it, but I suspect few actually did it, but some did it. And I don't know if you've ever looked into these sword fighting manuals written by authentics and masters. Well, they actually exist. I read one when I was pretty young, when I was a teenager. It hadn't been translated into English. It still hasn't been translated, but the classical Japanese was not too difficult. I could read it as a teenager. And it was Zen Master Takuan's treatise on basically enlightened sword fighting, how to be in combat and come from the no self. So there's a tradition of that. So in a sense, live blade combat from the no self, of course, to overcome fear and to enhance the reflexes, the reflexes are faster. And also it helps with the fear, because fencing is one thing where you're protected. Live blade combat, especially with a two-hand sword, where you can lop things off and kill people very quickly and very brutally, that creates enormous fear. So if you can sort of go into a no self state, your reflexes are faster and the fear factor is less. So that's the theory behind it. So we don't have live blade combat. But for Wino, the contemporary analogs, you might say live blade combat is a danger art. And you can\u2014the Zen and the art of, right? So there is this theory, like I say, I don't think it was realized very often in reality, but it's in the books. I'll let that just\u2014 So his thing was, what's a contemporary danger art that could be done as an expression of enlightenment? Racing ridiculously fast on a motorcycle. Not racing someone on a highway out in the country, but racing people in congested traffic in L.A. Modern danger art. I was imagining you were going to bring up something like Mulholland Drive, but evidently not. No, that's for wimps. His thing was, can I weave in and out of rush hour traffic at 100 miles an hour without causing any perturbations because I'm gone before they even realize that I've cut them off or whatever? That was his thing. And he could do that from the no-self. And you were riding on these\u2014 On the back, and I could\u2014it was communicated. I could feel that's what he was doing. So it was a communication. There aren't many people that could appreciate that particular art form or would even want to get within a thousand miles of that particular art form. I mean, even if you could appreciate it, you have to be a little crazy to want to be a part of it. But I was a little crazy back in those days, so I thought it was really cool. And we were stoned all the time. So this is all being done high on marijuana. It's crazy. And then when did this relationship end? Well, it didn't really end so much as I just realized I had other priorities. I had to spend more time teaching and other things. This is a hippie lifestyle. I had nothing to do but get high, meditate, and study. But then that evolved into more and more responsibilities. So this then becomes less and less relevant as I became established as a teacher and so forth. It's not like I rejected it, but it's just not really the thing for someone in my line of work to be doing. It's a phase. And by then you had your own center established? Yeah. I get the timing a little off, but yeah, I was moving into having my own center, etc., etc. And I will have to say that a major factor was eventually we did crash. Oh, wow. Now, it wasn't a big bad accident, but it was still\u2014 It could have been, though. Yeah. Anytime you go down on a motorcycle, you remember that. And it wasn't bad as far as motorcycle accidents. It was pretty trivial, actually. But still, you can even see the scars still there. There's a few others. That's from that accident. So we went down in Koreatown, and we actually walked to the ER, but we were pretty messed up. And then I realized, okay, this was a trivial accident. The next one. Now Wino, if you were to look at him naked, his skin has a harlequin patterning to it. The grain is different in every part of the body, meaning every cubic centimeter of his skin at one time or another has been road-rashed off. Wow. That's what they look like, these bikers. Yeah. So it's like, okay, sooner or later, this is going to end up with a serious accident. I can't really\u2014just for this entertainment value that I get, the game isn't worth the candle. Right. So there's that. Right. And in your teaching, what, if anything, were you teaching other than meditation, for example? Asian languages. Oh, okay. I could actually charge for that. I made some money teaching Asian languages. Were those studies, you know, basic Buddhist history or folklore? Oh, yeah. I was teaching, you're right. I taught at Ernest Holmes College, which is a seminary for the Church of Religious Science. I taught meditation and comparative religion for many years. I forgot that was the source of income. I also taught for Chaplain College. Oh, in Orange County? Well, but for their on-the-ground operation, they specialize in bringing education to people that already are in professions and want to get a higher academic degree, like a master or maybe even a PhD. So they teach cops. They have people live on, say, a Navy vessel and teach regular college subjects to people that want to do upper division or graduate work. In other words, they post you, that's a specialty that Chapman has, that they'll actually post you in the workplace because people, they have an interesting business model, which is, well, people that are working, it's a big deal to travel to a campus to take classes, so we'll bring the teacher to you. So they had a philosophies of Asia course that they had to give every six years or something like that to keep up their accreditation for their department of philosophy. There's certain things you have to teach, philosophies of Asia is one. So Brian had taught, I think, that for Chapman, and I think he was actually on a ship. I could be wrong. He was teaching to sailors. And when he had to do other things, he recommended I take over that course. And so I met with the head of that aspect of Chapman College. You're right, their campus is down in Orange, but they would do these things. And they had me teach nurses in the LA area. So I would go into a hospital, typically it was a hospital, and I would teach philosophies of Asia to nurses. So I forgot that I did actually have a legitimate income stream from teaching world religion and meditation at Ernest Holmes College. And it's sort of interesting because my mother was a follower of the science of mind, and my rabbi was very close friends with Ernest Holmes. So that was a kind of full circle thing. We were in Westwood Temple. What was then called Ernest Holmes, well, the headquarters for the science of mind was just up the street, a little east of that. That was called Ernest Holmes College during this period. So I taught for them, and I taught for Chapman. So that was a legitimate income stream, not a lot, but I was living pretty marginally in terms of expenses. And then from Wino I got the dope, and I would sell that mostly to one very rich client who was very rich and very paranoid. So that's how I was living. Now in terms of what we usually think of when people teach, they have some kind of credentials that they list after their name to indicate that they're\u2014 I have credentials because I am technically PhD ABD. That means PhD all but dissertation. I was never disciplined enough to write my dissertation, but I passed my prelims. I did all the coursework to qualify for a PhD in Buddhist studies from the University of Wisconsin program. So technically I'm PhD ABD, and actually that does count for something in the academic world. Now later on I was actually given a doctorate, honoris causa, from the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, but they're an accredited college, and that degree is actually a valid doctorate degree. But I didn't have that back when we're talking, but I had the PhD ABD degree. And it seems that at earlier stages, for example in the 1970s, maybe people who wanted to learn meditation weren't so interested in things like lineages and traditions that people studied with and what the significance of that is. But I had the lineage cred also if I needed to show it, because technically I'm an ajari, A-J-A-R-I, legally. And ajari is the Japanese pronunciation of acharya. In Thailand they pronounce it achan. Right, Dharma teacher. Something like that. But it means something specific in Shingon. That means you've completed the basic kegyo training. Plus Dr. Tianan eventually made me a daidu, technically, when I was in a more monastic role. So that's equivalent to a Tara in Theravada Buddhism. As you know, when they speak English and French, they call it a venerable, typically. So I actually did have the lineage cred, technically speaking, and academic cred, technically speaking. By the way, one of the... Teaching Vipassana, this is one of the things that is just fascinating, I think. And I think I told you how I sort of transitioned from Zen to... But one last little thing, when I was teaching at Ernest Holmes College, one of my students, he was very close to graduation at the time, but he went on to become a very prominent mega-church minister. That's Michael Beckwith. Do you know Michael? I've heard the name, yeah. So he and I go way back. Wow, that's very cool. So one of the things I wanted to ask you about is, particularly in connection with teaching meditation, there's a lot, especially nowadays, a lot more that's known about various techniques or various approaches that can or cannot be deemed entirely safe for some people. For example, people with very intense trauma in their background, or people who have various psychological issues that might get triggered or might get stimulated in some way. When you were teaching meditation in the 1970s, how much experience did you have having to deal with people coming in with challenging issues? One of the things that I can't help but notice from my own experience being that these sorts of things do often attract people with a lot of deep issues, even mental problems. Well, I started at IBMC. I think I might have mentioned that the way I would describe IBMC in those days is with the Chinese expression, dragons and snakes all tangled together. So there were a lot of crazies. I mean a lot, but they weren't necessarily meditating. They were just getting a free room because it wasn't required to be a meditator. So in general, that center at that time was a magnet for unbalanced people, I would say. So yeah, broadly yes, saw that. Now in my current teaching situation, not so much, not nearly as much, because things are much more organized now and people typically would not be studying with me unless they had quite a commitment. That's not to say though that we've never had people crack up as the result of practice. It has happened. But I would not say it was frequent. But I would say that in just about every case where we've had someone have an untoward outcome from meditation, they had already had some sort of psychotic break before coming and they did some very intense practice. Because one of the features of our retreats is we let people practice as intensely or not intensely as they want. Everything's optional on my retreats. So if someone wants to really bear down and sit for four hours and then sit for another four hours, be my guest. But they don't have to. Everything is optional at our retreats. One of the optional is, we always have in the middle of the retreat an option of meditating all night, going the whole night without sleeping. It's called yaza in Japanese, extra-curricular night sitting. So people could have major chemical changes because of yaza, and they could in theory do very, very intense extended practice at a retreat. As far as I know, the few times we have had a problem, it was sort of like when the planes crash. It's not one thing, it's a concatenation. They had a predisposition. They'd had problems before. They'd had a psychotic break before. And they did something really intense, often involving an all-night sit. Something that without the preclivity and without the intense practice, at least in my experience, the way that I have people practice, it's unlikely to have a psychologically negative outcome, just statistically. I think it could happen, but it's always been highly correlated with the two factors I just mentioned. Do you want to try to get that? No. Okay. All right. We're back. Perhaps in comparison to your earlier teaching years in the 1970s here and going up to the present day, how might your legal protection for yourself have evolved or not? Well, in the old days I had no legal protection. And now for many, many, many, many years I have insurance. But I'm not sure what kind of insurance it is because someone else buys it for me. I mean, my staff finds it and I mean, I pay for it. So I think I'm covered, not sure about right now, but I think for many years, I think even now I'm covered by an insurance group that insures personal trainers. I think that's what they put me under. But I could also have ministerial, ministers have this. And I may have had that at one time also, but I am definitely covered. Never had to use it. Wow. That's great. So how long did your teaching years here in LA last? When did you make the change? I think I moved to Vermont 22 years ago. So we could do the math on that, just count back. And what led to that decision? There was, and I don't know if we've talked about this or not, some problem in my community. We didn't talk about codependency. Okay. There's so much to talk about. So turn it off. Okay. I'm going to turn it off. There was a person that was a positive factor in my life, but also I got into a codependent relationship with them. And that led to problems in my meditation communities. By this time I had communities everywhere because I was acting in a distorted way. I knew from the beginning of my teaching career that there were three things anyone who functions as a meditation teacher or broadly as a minister or even a therapist, anyone in these kinds of helping professions, I knew from the get-go that there's three big things that you have to constantly be watching for. It's in the guru's manual in bold. Money, sex, and power. People give you money and they say this is to repair the temple roof. You damn well better repair the temple roof and not buy a new statue and certainly not use it to have a vacation. So I knew about money because a lot of the money comes in, it's donations, and that has to be handled very cleanly. I knew about sex, how many times has it happened. And I knew about the power thing because I've noticed a disturbing tendency among meditation teachers to think that just because they know a lot about meditation they have the right to tell people how to live their lives. Oh you should do this, you should do that, make this move, make that move. And the sex aspect often is part of that. Yeah, or it could be marry this person because I'm the teacher and blah blah blah. Man that really rubs me the wrong way when I see that, but I've seen a lot of that. So I knew. And also burning people down, not necessarily even abusing them but just working them to death for a good cause, you know. It happens, right? So to be honest I was always watching out for that from the get-go. Watch the sex thing, watch the money thing, watch the power thing, you have power, just don't casually suggest things to people because they'll think they're, you know, etc. etc. Don't overwork people because it's for a good cause, etc. So I was pretty good. Problem is the Guru's manual doesn't mention all of the potholes. Mentions the big three. There was another one that I just had to learn the hard way because it wasn't in the manual. But once I had that quote valuable life lesson, then I started to see it all over the place. Not as much as the big three, but now I've seen it, it's there. And the number four is codependent relationships that a teacher can enter into with a person who is not a teacher but thinks they're entitled because of the relationship. So I didn't know to look for that. I didn't even know it existed as a category. And so, well, forewarned is forearmed. But if you're not forewarned, then you might get blindsided, fall into a pothole. And so that's how it happened. It was a person I had this relationship with. Some ways it was very positive, but in other ways it was starting to really cause people in my communities to be concerned. So much so that two very, very famous senior teachers, Jack Kornfield and James Baraz, more or less had to call me up to San Francisco, take me out to dinner. And they didn't use these words, but it was essentially, Shinze, what the fuck's going on? So that plus the feedback from my community, finally it sunk in. Oh, I've really been off. And it was a slippery slope, you know? Didn't really see it coming. So I needed to make a break. I needed to move away from this person. So the way I did that initially was, like the classic, if you break up with your girlfriend or something, you go stay with your best friend. So that's what I did. Now the best friend in this case is Bill Hamilton, who was\u2014if he hadn't died young, he'd be a very prominent mindfulness teacher. He tragically died very young. But we were co-teachers of each other and very good friends for many years. He was living in LA at that time. He knew the nitty-gritty of how mindfulness practice works, based on the fact that he had studied directly with Upandita, maybe even directly with Mahasi, had had access to all their manuals. But he also had a science background, an engineering background, so he could explain to me, this is how mindfulness practice works, the mechanisms. And particularly, among other things, the importance of different flavors of what I currently call flow, or what is traditionally called anicca, or impermanency, how that's a real important signpost as people are approaching quote, stream entry and so forth. So he made the whole thing make sense to me. So we were sort of co-teachers to each other, because he understood Burmese vipassana a lot better than Mahasi, but I had a background in East Asian Buddhism and in Vajrayana from my academic studies. He didn't know that much about that, so we could teach each other. It was great. It was a great situation where we both brought something to the table that was useful. He had two students that were proper students of his, who are now out there teaching. Daniel Ingram is one, and Kenneth Folk is the other. And they have both sort of stirred the pot of North American Buddhism in a way that needed to be stirred, because there's been a tendency in North American Buddhism to marginalize meditative attainments in general, and specifically stream entry as a goal. But in Zen, the equivalent of stream entry, which is called Kensho, is looked upon as a feasible goal. My teacher assumed I would quote, eventually have Kensho. That was an assumption of Okamura. That's sort of the whole point, or really half the point. So he talked about it, and he said, it's out there, go out and get it. Mainstream North American Buddhism has had a tendency to not use that kind of language, and in fact, to eschew it. Which yes, we understand, because if you start talking like that, then it becomes a comparison game. It's in many ways antithetical to where you're trying to go to make it into. So yeah, we get that, but also things can go too extreme in the other direction, and people just sort of, no offense meant, but their whole meditation career is they learn how to smile and breathe. So there's more to it, a lot more to it than that, especially from a Zen perspective. Well the Mahasi tradition expects people to become stream enters, and they talk about how to go out and do it. And so Bill Hamilton taught that way. And of course that perfectly aligned with the Zen thing, so it was all natural to me. So Dan Ingram, Daniel Ingram, is in a sense my brother teacher, in that we were both influenced by Bill Hamilton. And so he wrote a book, Mastering the Koi Teachings of the Buddha. You may be familiar with it. But he basically said, stream entry is feasible, and if you're serious about Buddhism, you should be going for it, and here's how to go for it. And how do I know? And this is where he probably did not make a wise decision. How do I know? Because I'm an arhat. Well, I'm not sure that was a good idea to say that. But the other part actually needed to be said. How much do you think the danger of addressing the audience of Westerners who are largely goal-oriented, competitive, selfish-ish, in many ways ego-centered, I guess you could put it, informed this attempt to undervalue this sort of approach? In other words, this direction of having it be less goal-oriented, less specifically \ufffd if you want to attain this. I mean, there's a lot of talk, especially in Zen, about not having a gaining idea, not looking at attainment as being really what it's about, which has, I think, historically been difficult for Westerners who tend to be conditioned already to be very goal-oriented. Well, yeah. I tend to see it not in terms of Westerners, but in terms of all humans. When you \ufffd and I can make a metaphor from science. Light, the natural phenomenon of light, hugely controversial for centuries, not for a short time. When you had intellectual giants lining up in two camps, look at it. Clearly it's a particle. You can see by what it does that it has momentum. It's like little beebees, right? No, clearly it's a wave. It's subject to dispersion and diffraction, like a wave, right? You can see when it goes through a hole, it spreads out. It doesn't just \ufffd so there's a lot of evidence that light is particulate, and there's a lot of evidence that light is a wave. You can line up century after century, starting with Newton and Robert Hooke and moving on to Huygens and Young and many, many other giants. They just argued back and forth, and sometimes it wasn't all that polite either, back and forth for several centuries until modern physics, where you are told, get over it, like it or not. There's both these ways to look at it. It's a pretty good metaphor for the history of contemplative practice worldwide, everywhere. Christianity, we can see the same tendencies, Islam. What is the contemplative path about? Well, let's just say that there's something called being complete, for example. Well, okay. There's actually two ways to be complete. You can be complete through cultivated improvements, and you can be complete through seeing you always are or are complete. There's primordial completeness that's there in everyone always, and then there's cultivated improvements that come by elevating your base level of concentration, clarity, and equanimity that improves how you process information. The experience of self and world that you have if you follow a path of cultivated improvement in your information processing and the place you end up if you find the primordial completeness, so the cultivated completeness, primordial completeness, it's the same place. Both approaches have a validity to them. You can do both. My system involves both. I've got self-inquiry kinds of things. I've got expansion-contraction. I've got do-nothing. Those are all sort of working from the just see that there's nowhere to go kind of thing. But then I've got see, hear, feel, and focus in, focus out, which is sort of like training completeness in the sense gates gradually over a period of time. They converge. So there's a place for both. I see no reason not to include both. However, in previous centuries, it has been argued back and forth and back and forth because each of those approaches has problems associated with it. So human beings are very designed to be sensitive to problems. All the negative emotions are really distinct\u2014rage, terror, grief, shame, impatience, disgust. That's six. They're really distinct. Positive emotions, interest, joy, love, gratitude, humor, smile, much less distinct. Darwin has created us to really notice aversive things. Makes sense, right? Survival. Yeah. I mean, it's just deep, deep in natural selection. So each approach has problems. And of course, you're a teacher, you see people use one approach. You see the problems, and you're a human, so the problems look very big. And so, well, then you sort of make a statement that's not really quite correct, because you're trying to balance that. So well, you'll never get there by meditating. It's like trying to polish a brick, famous Zen thing. So we could list all the problems associated with being goal-oriented in practice, but we could also list the problems associated with basically being complacent in practice. And I don't think that one of those is bigger than the other. So I really don't think that people in the United States are more goal-driven than people in India or China. Maybe goal-driven in a different way, but what's expected of people in those cultures and how miserable they are because of that is every bit comparable to here, if not worse, actually. So I don't think it's like a modern Western thing. It's a human thing. So Daniel stirred the pot. And I think that was a very important contribution to modern Buddhism in the Western world. Because whatever an arhat is or isn't, we may debate. But in my mind, I have not a scintilla of doubt that he has had deep, authentic experience of liberation. So it's not just ideas that he's conveying, it's experience. And of course, people that follow him develop all the problems that we could predict. You could see them on the internet arguing with each other about their putative attainments as expected. But on the other hand, at least they're working their butts off. And they probably will get somewhere eventually. So it's a dialectical process. My thing is just to make the strong case that both of these approaches are valid. It's a wave, it's a particle. It's cultivated improvement. It's primordial perfection. It's something you need to work hard to get to. It's something that you need to let go of doing this so it can get to you. And there's no way around it. It's both sides. So anyway, Bill Hamilton. You stayed with him. Stayed with him. It was a classic case. Metaphorically I was leaving my girlfriend and my wife, metaphorically. And then I got a call, or I had gotten a call, from a programmer in Vermont that had gotten my audio tapes from the Dharma Seed Library. Now this is related to Bill Hamilton, because Bill Hamilton helped Jack and Joseph a lot back in the early days by providing cheap or in fact free Dharma Talk tapes. This is before files. These are physical tapes. Because he'd been an engineer, he knew how to mass produce things, so he created something that probably still exists called the Dharma Seed Library, provided tapes of teachers. And my tapes were among those. That's how he knew me originally. Now Bill Kouratos in Vermont had been a Zen student, and he was looking for tapes about Zen. And my name is Shinzen. But of course the Zen of my name is a different kanji, it's not the Zen of Zen Buddhism, but there's no way to know that if you just look at my name written in Roman script. So he thought, oh, this guy must be a Zen teacher. And those tapes were cheap, so it was good. So he started to listen, and because he's very logical, he's a creature of great logic, he and I both always root for the Borg Collective, because we think they're very logical. No, actually that's not quite true. We both used to root for the Borg Collective against humans. And we always still root for the machines to beat the chess players or the gold players. We're just creatures of logic. But then I showed him a logical flaw in the Borg philosophy, which he had to admit, and then he stopped rooting for the Borg also, which I can go into if you want. But there is a logical flaw in their philosophy. Anyway, we're both creatures of logic to the extreme. So he started listening to my tapes, they're coming from a very geeky, mindfulness perspective. I wasn't talking about Zen at all. And he said, wow, this is good. This is all logic and evidence, and I like logic and evidence. So he contacted me and said, can I hypertext your talks, put them on the internet? The internet was just starting then. This is at the inception. I said, well, you can, but I've always had this dream of creating an interactive multimedia algorithm that actually in real time guides people, because I have created this systematic procedure that I think we've talked about. So can I interest you in an incomparably more ambitious undertaking of you and I write interactive software? So now there's a million mindfulness apps. But there was a time when, as far as I know, I was the only human being that had that idea. That was 22 years ago, approximately. So he didn't want to come to LA. He liked Burlington, Vermont, because he had studied in cities rated, the different dimensions of ratings for different cities, and the boxes that were checkboxes for him for the kind of city he wanted to live in. Burlington fit the bill. So small town in a very liberal state in New England. So he did not want to leave Burlington, Vermont. And I was ready for a real change of venue. It's like small town in New England, that's new. Let's try that. And so we began to work together, and we have created certain programs that have been tested at Carnegie Mellon. But also that led to a connection with Green Mountain Coffee. Have we gone into that? No. Well, that's a whole thing. Because Green Mountain Coffee evolved into the Keurig Empire. And that was Bob Stiller's dream. And Bob Stiller had a dream for the future of coffee. He's in the Coffee Hall of Fame. And the company was originally Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, based, as you might guess, in Vermont. Yes, right. Hence the Green Mountain. Well, Bob had a dream, and I had a dream. And he found out I was in Vermont. And he contacted me about us helping each other's dreams. That's a whole conversation which we should definitely go into. But let me just say that it entailed not only teaching him, but teaching all of his workers and his family. He had a daughter and two little boys at the time. I taught the two boys. And now the little boys are adults. And one of them is Christian Stiller. And Christian wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, not in coffee, but in being a successful business person. And he's also committed to mindfulness as the best thing that can happen to the world. So my original dream of an interactive program, that's why I went to Vermont. Well Bill and I did build one for the use of science that was used very successfully at Carnegie Mellon. We can talk about what they did, but that was in the Dave Creswell lab. At Carnegie Mellon. But Christian has gone off and created Bright Mind, which is a commercial product that instantiates the unified mindfulness system, which is what I currently call my approach, in somewhat interactive software. So it's all connected. That's how I went to Vermont. Maybe this is a break point. Yeah, I wanted to ask you one more thing and then we'll probably be done. Since I was going to ask this anyway, and you mentioned you brought up Jack and James Burroughs and Joseph Goldstein. What if any connection did you develop during your developing teaching years with what became the Insight Meditation? I've never had a strong connection with them, but MBSR is a different thing. These are very, very different things. MBSR is John's thing. These other things are there, although we're all friends. I was going to say there are connections there. Yeah, we're all connected because there weren't that many of us back in the day. We're all sometimes referred to as the pioneer generation. Jack, Joseph, John Kabat-Zinn, we all, and me and many others, we went to Asia in the 60s. Right. We were the ones. So we've had friendly relationships forever. Not close, not working together kinds of relationships, except occasionally, but just mutually supportive and sort of a mutual appreciation society kind of stuff. Uh-huh, okay. That's what I wondered. So when you have a lot\u2014 Same with me and John Kabat-Zinn. Not working together very much, but sort of mutually admiring from a distance kind of thing, I would say. Yeah. Well, there was also for a while there was definitely a bi-coastal aspect to this. I mean you were out here, they were back east. Yeah, but then when Jack came out here, there was still a north-south thing, right? Yeah, exactly. Because the north has more Buddhism than it needs. So my bailiwick was Southern California. I was the only act in\u2014well, as far as mindfulness goes, there probably was a time when I was the main presence here. So I just sort of kept in my geographical lane because there's so much to do anyway. What kind of changes did you see over the years before you left in terms of the Buddhist community development here, especially among the non-ethnic Buddhists? There are always plenty of ethnic Buddhists in the area, obviously. But just that exponential growth, which at the beginning looks like lackluster linear, but you could still see that it was growing. So it looked like it was growing. But I never thought it would take off the way it appears to be taking off now. Because now we're talking about\u2014well, I'll tell you a story with me and Jack. So many years ago we started to have teacher meetings up at Spirit Rock. And at the beginning there weren't that many. I mean like 20 people. I can remember a quote teacher meeting. There were maybe 20 of us there at Spirit Rock. And I don't think his center was completed yet. They were building it. And I can remember I was up there, he was there, Ruth Denison was there, a bunch of other people, small group. And we were sitting around talking about, well, what's your dreams? Just schmoozing about it. And I shared where I hoped things would go. Now this may be 30 years ago. I'm bad about dates, but it could easily have been 30 years ago. And I don't know if you know, but Jack has a great sense of humor. And he said, oh, I see what Shenzhen's interested in. It's not stream entry, it's mainstream entry. And mainstream entry is a Fed company at this point. Yeah, totally. Who would have ever thunk it? I'll tell you another story, I can't name names. But I was just talking to a friend of mine that is prominent as a producer in the studio system, Hollywood. He makes movies, okay? It's nothing to do with television. He got a call directly from the president of one of the three networks, not from the producer of a TV show, from the president of the network. We've got a show that's in big trouble PR-wise, or about to be in big trouble PR-wise, and we need a mindfulness guy to come in and clean it up. Now my friend, who makes movies, is known in the industry of movies as someone who has a deep practice. And it shows in the way he does business. People love it, very different from the way a lot of people do business in his area. So it's a little bit out there, okay? But now we've reached the point where someone that's not even his boss, that's in another part of the entertainment industry, has a major problem. And it's like, we need mindfulness to fix this problem, and oh, that producer over there, he's the mindfulness guy for the movies, so let's talk to him. The culture has reached that point. That is beyond. That is so beyond anything that we pioneer hippies would have ever thought possible. I told you my thing about the church father, Tertullian. Do we ever talk about that? I know who that is, but I don't remember if it's talked about. So Tertullian was an interesting person. He was a martyr, actually. But he lived at an interesting transition period, where Christianity was in between being a kooky, marginal, persecuted, foreign cult to being the mainstream culture and source of all power in Europe. So he straddled. They were still persecuted, he ended up getting martyred, but he could see the writing on the wall. And there's this great phrase in Latin, we who are but of yesterday are now in all your cities and camps. In other words, it was just a few, well, more than a few generations, but a few hundred years, right? For us, though, things move faster now. So for him, it was a few centuries ago. And he could see in a few centuries, we're going to be running the show. So for us, it's a few decades ago. I don't know if we're going to be running the show, but it may have a very significant impact on how things move. So we who are but of yesterday, the pioneers, the hippie, weirdos, the marginal characters like me that went to Asia, we're not only in all your cities, we're in your boardrooms, your therapy rooms, your military training camps, your hospitals. And it could be that it's just starting, just now getting going. So it's pretty amazing. We have a lot still to try to cover. If you want. You mentioned Nicola, you mentioned Green Mountain Coffee. We still have plenty to talk about, but we'll look forward to getting some of that. Well, you can say no mas at some point because... Because obviously this could go on absolutely forever. A lot. But it's so great. I don't want to miss any of this good stuff. Well, good. My pleasure.
