{"text": " Okay, you ready? Okay. All right. Today is June 26 2017. This is Alex Cline. I'm interviewing Shinzen Young at this beautiful home in Pacific Palisades. And this is session number one. Good morning. Morning. It's a real honor and a pleasure to be able to have this opportunity to interview you while you're here in town briefly. And we know that you originally are from here. We're going to hear about that today. Although now you're living in Vermont. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. So we're going to get as much as we can while you're here. The first question is always the same question, which is where and when were you born? I was born in Los Angeles on August 7 1944. Okay. And let's start with some family background, beginning with your father. What do you know about your father's family background? And what did he do for a living? And what was his name? My father's name was Roy Young. Although I think it was originally Ruben Yampolsky that was then anglicized so that we could be assimilated a little bit more. So his parents, I think both of his parents were from Russia or the Ukraine, probably the Ukraine, would be my guess. They spoke Yiddish at home. And he was from Chicago. So he was born in this country. And at one point they were either near or in Waukegan, Illinois, I think. I'm not sure they're from the city. In fact, I think they're not from the city of Chicago. They're from Illinois. I think that they were farmers. And I think, not sure about this, but I think his biological mother died in the plague after World War I. And so he was raised by a stepmother, but they would have both been Ukrainian-Russian. Oh, wait, I know that I think the father must have been Ukrainian because he said that they came from Kiev, Gubernia. So that would have been in that part of Russia. So my grandparents were part of that wave of emigration out of Tsarist Russia as Jews. So that's what I know about that. And what did your father do for- He was an optometrist in Huntington Park. Okay. There were three Jewish optometrists in his building, or no, no, in the city of Huntington Park. They used to have lunch together every day. And he was the more senior, so they sort of looked upon him as a model. I can remember that, we're not too chronological here, but when I came back from Japan, there was one Japanese word that my father could recognize, which is that we were eating sushi, or I took him to sushi, or I was talking about sushi, which had not yet at all been a popular thing. For sure. And I told him my favorite sushi was the one with salmon roe, which the Japanese call ikura, which is one of the few Russian loanwords into Japanese. It's the Russian word for caviar in general, I think. And he recognized that word because that's what his mother had called fish eggs and whatever. So I guess that's a little bit of something. So he grew up understanding Yiddish, and in what I'm imagining would have been an Orthodox Jewish environment. And what about your mother's family background? Well, it's a little bit similar. And what's her name? Frances Young. Frances Young. I've got a tribute to her on the internet that I put up. So her father was also Russian or Ukrainian, but her mother was Viennese, or at least, I think, once again, I think from the countryside around Vienna maybe. And they were Jewish also. The last name is Brown, but they Anglicized it like B-R-O-W-N. Right. Now, I never knew my father's parents, but I was sort of raised when I was very little by my grandmother, because my mother was working in the garment industry in downtown LA, which was actually a very common job for Jewish people at that time. And my father was not yet an optometrist, obviously, when I was very little. He was off fighting the Japanese in the Pacific, ironically, when I was born. 1944, the war was still going on. Oh, right. Yeah, interesting how things evolve over time. So I think my grandmother raised me, and her husband was still alive, and I can remember when he passed away. And he was also in the garment industry. I think he was a, he was something in the garment industry. And yeah, that's what I remember about that. And so, at least for those first years, where did you grow up in the LA area? Well, I think that they maybe were in Boyle Heights. I think that there was a Jewish part of town before Fairfax, or I don't know the timeline on that, but it's now a Hispanic part of town. And in fact, it's probably under one of those freeways, I think, where that house was. I think they said it was on a street called Casio Street. Oh, yeah. Does that sound like it's in Boyle Heights? Yeah, down in that area. And that was actually a very heavily Russian Jewish neighborhood before it also became, oddly enough, a Japanese American neighborhood. And of course, now it's a largely Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Yeah, so I think that's where it was. They were sticking with their own immigrant thing. My mother was quite good-looking. She was attractive. That was something. And my father's sister, Belle, was married to a moderately well-known actor of the time who had been in vaudeville and then was, I think, at silent movies and then did a lot of character parts in mainstream movies. His name was Billy Gilbert. You can find him on the IMDb. He played in a lot of big movies, but very small roles. But it meant that my father had connections to the entertainment industry through their social circle. So, I'm pretty sure he knew Laurel and Hardy and other people like that. Do you know how your parents wound up, number one, meeting and number two, coming to Los Angeles? I'm going to guess they met in Los Angeles. Okay. And I don't remember how they got together. But as I say, my mother was quite good-looking. And I do know that what my dad did was borrow Billy Gilbert's high-end car. I forgot what the make was, but it was something that more wealthy people had, not people schlepping in the garment industry. So, when he took her on the first date, he had this impressive car that he borrowed from his sister's husband, Hollywood, so they have to have these status symbols. So, I think that impressed her. Wow. So, how long did they stay in Boyle Heights? Well, I think they may have met after my\u2014I'm not sure that they met at the Boyle Heights or at a later time. My grandmother had a house on\u2014I'm guessing that the street might have been called Grand View, and it would have been near Venice, Venice Boulevard. It was not far from where I grew up. I grew up on Colonial Avenue, which crosses Venice Boulevard. I forgot what the bigger cross street is, but it's the Mar Vista area. Yeah, I was going to say that's Mar Vista. That's right. So, I think there was a Grand View and Mar Vista. That's where they lived later on, and they meaning my maternal grandparents. So, I don't know what was between Boyle Heights and Mar Vista, if anything, but I'm not sure when they got together. Might have been after they had moved to the Mar Vista area. Okay. So, you grew up in that area? I grew up in Mar Vista, yeah, basically. Let's start with your early years, beginning with school. Where did you go to elementary school? In Beethoven. It's probably still there. It is still there, yeah. I went to Beethoven. Before that, I was in some sort of day place, I guess because my parents were working. Both working, yeah. Which was, I'm pretty sure, a Jewish day center for kids. I'm not entirely sure. I could vaguely remember that. And then I was in Beethoven. Okay. Any subjects that you started to, early on, become interested in or skilled at? Well, I had an attraction to science-y things. I like science fiction movies. And my dad got me a chemistry set and an optical bench. And those were my favorite toys. And an erector set, which was a popular toy at that time. I just loved playing with that stuff. So, that was a general direction. I did not like school at all, even starting in elementary school, but really had a negative reaction to what was then called junior high, now called middle school. I was in Mark Twain, which was sort of tough. And I did very poorly academically. So, then they moved me to Webster, and I did a little better, but not very good. Now, Webster must have been a pretty new school at that time. Maybe. I, in general, did rather poorly in school, academically. Okay. What about siblings? Any siblings? Yeah, I have a younger brother, four years younger. Oh, okay. Before we go more into the school story, going back to your parents again, starting with your father, how would you describe your father as a father, and what was your relationship like with him? Well, I think big picture-wise, really wonderful, because they provided a very rich environment for me, both my parents. They had a circle of politically liberal and culturally very alive friends, and they would talk a lot. So, I was exposed to sophisticated adult conversation at an early age, and philosophy, politics, culture, science, they would just talk about stuff. So, I think that was an early imprinting. Even though I did very poorly in school, I was actually interested in a lot of things because of that rich environment. They took an active role to foster my interest by buying me science toys and things like that. And then, later on in life, when I became interested in Asian culture, they paid for me to go to Japanese school. It didn't cost much, like $5 a month or something, but they encouraged it. They thought it was good. When I got a little older and realized, so I first went to Japanese school, and then that continued throughout high school, Sawtelle Japanese Language Institute. But later on in high school, I realized I would never be able to understand Japan at the depth I wanted to, unless I also could read and speak Chinese, because China has a very strong historical influence on Japanese culture. So, my parents dutifully got me a Northern Chinese woman to be a Mandarin tutor. I didn't want to go to Cantonese ethnic school because I knew that I needed to learn Mandarin, which is the national language based on North Chinese. So, instead of doing what I did with doing what I did with Japanese, which was go to Asian ethnic school, they got me a private tutor for Northern Chinese. And then, later on, just before I went into college, but I was still in high school, I realized I would never be able to fully understand China without understanding Buddhism. And therefore, I would need to learn something about India. And the trick would be to master the classical language of India, which is Sanskrit. So, my parents dutifully paid for me to have a Sanskrit tutor. Judith Tyberg was maybe the only person teaching Sanskrit. I was wondering how they would even find that. The East-West Center she had, I think I found her. But she had written a book, and she was a follower of maybe Aurobindo, I'm thinking, one of those people. I was very Hindu-y, which was exotic and interesting. She tutored me in pronunciation and the beginnings of Sanskrit grammar. So, a couple patterns are emerging. One is that I had a few very good intuitions. I think I've been blessed with good intuitions about how to proceed in areas. When I got interested in Asian culture, I just knew mastery of the languages was the secret. If you want to do that, you learn the languages, that's it. And I think that is the correct way to go about mastering a culture. So, hence, an engagement with many languages. Of course, I can't speak them all, but I've had contact with many languages. Because to me, I had this insight on my own early in life that mastery of the language is the key to the culture. Now, what is ironic is that for a couple years, I didn't know how to get an education in the Japanese language. There was no internet. There were not a gazillion fantastic free sources available like now to learn. In fact, there was, as far as I can remember, only one grammar of Japanese in English. Certainly, the libraries that I had access to only had this one. It was by a good scholar, Samuel Martin. That was the grammar of Japanese. That's all I had. So, I started with that. But then I found out after a couple years that there's Japanese ethnic school. So, I went to Japanese ethnic school. Then I was now immersed in the culture while still being in LA. But I can remember at Venice High, where I also did very poorly. But I can remember being completely disinterested in all my classes at Venice High. The only thing I was interested in was reading my Japanese grammar book. Here's the irony. Fast forward many decades, Venice High became an Asian language education hub for LA. So, the place where I went, where I was this odd person and did poorly in school and could barely find a resource to learn a language no one gave a shit about who wasn't Asian. Ironically, that's like Asian language hub now. So, it's like I was really ahead of my time in a certain way. Absolutely. So, I've had these intuitions. Another one was when I eventually got interested in science that if you want to master science, you need to master math. That's at the base of the pyramid. So, language is at the base of cultural understanding. So, I've always been able to sort of see what was at the base. Math is at the base of scientific understanding. And then the other intuition that I had, which turned out to be very correct, is that meditation is at the base of all understanding, all disciplines, every part of life. If you want to master life, you learn how to meditate. So, I would say that I've been fortunate to have maybe four intuitions about things that have turned out to be very correct. One was the importance of language, really mastering the language, speaking. I used, not now, but when I lived in Japan, because I eventually did go to Japan, I had something nigh unto native fluency in Japanese, and reading and writing too, to where I could call a stranger on the phone and they did not know they were talking sometimes to an American. And that was unheard of in the 60s for a non-Asian person. So, seeing a language mastery, that's the key to culture. And then math mastery, that's the key to science. And meditation mastery is the key to everything, math and language and everything else. And then the other intuition that I had that turned out to be very right was that one of the most important things that could happen in the then 20th century, now 21st century, is for the world of meditation and the world of science to cross-fertilize. So, in other words, I guess I could characterize the arc of my life as an early fascination with Asian cultures, which, and in Asian culture, meditation practice is part of the culture. So, I encountered meditation because of an interest in the culture, which led to an understanding that meditation was important for everything. And therefore, in a sense, the technology of meditation transcends the culture of its origin. It's something that's relevant to the whole world. So, if Asia is a mountain, and I started out at the base of that mountain as an outsider, and learned a number of languages and became accepted in that. I was on a path to becoming a light-skinned, big-nosed Japanese person. I mean, if I had, and I have friends who stayed in Japan, and essentially that's what has happened to them, just as a Japanese person would become an American if they stayed here. I was on that path to just being incorporated into their society. But ironically, because I came to the peak of what that culture has to offer, I could see that this is of an importance far beyond this one culture. It's not just something from this culture, something the whole world needs universally. I looked off and I asked myself, is there something else, analogous, something universal, powerful, not really part of a culture, when you go far with it? And there was just one other thing, and that was science. So it's like, oh, okay, what if they come together? And it turns out that I wasn't the only person thinking that, although I didn't know at the time, that others were, that was a zeitgeist that people were aligning with. So I got involved in that at a very early period. So I knew that I needed meditation to be a human, but I got that from Asian culture. But then I sort of lost interest in Asian culture. I mean, I like it, but I don't prefer it to Western culture, not in the slightest. I like it all, because in a sense, there was no more for me to learn about Asian culture. I'd gone to the top, and the top transcends the culture. The same is true for science. And then I got the, I mean, it was pointed out to me, but then I could see it myself, that mastering math was the secret to mastering science. So I had that intuition, and then I had the intuition to bring the science and the meditation together. And that has actually somewhat turned out to be a major theme. And I was just fortunate, because I got an early start. So in your growing up in your home, there's this amazing amount of support, it sounds like, for your interests. Yeah. Now there were problems also, because my parents were at the early phase, rather immature and hyper-emotional, and so was I. So there was a lot of yelling and screaming and that kind of stuff, a lot. And there was a lot of me having tantrums, but they having tantrums. And sometimes that would lead to physical violence, nothing severe, I mean, but they definitely would hit us and hit you with a hanger or something like that. And so there was a lot of sturm und drang, a lot of emotional turmoil, which to everyone's credit eventually completely went away, but that was later in life, much later. Yeah. And they were into alcohol and infidelity. I don't know if it was some intersection of infidelity and people were doing swapping and swinging, you know, but so eventually they got divorced. Oh, I see. But then they actually got back together. So I attended my parents' second wedding. Amazing. And I think infidelity and alcohol played a major role in all that. And based on what we've heard already, it sounds like, well, we know that they were Jewish and that there was a more liberal, probably political identification. Stevensonian Democrats. Oh, yeah, of course. Like my own parents, by the way. But I guess one of the things I'm wondering about is during the 50s, it's also, of course, the McCarthy era, and it wasn't a particularly safe place to have certain ideas. You said you were around a lot of interesting conversations with the grownups. And of course, it was the Cold War. In terms of that overall political climate, what might you remember, not only from your own experience, but from what maybe you were able to ascertain? Well, I remember that they were devastated when Stevenson failed to win twice, I guess. Yeah. That was devastating to them. I don't remember a lot of specific talk about McCarthyism. Everyone, I mean, I do remember the bomb drills. I don't know if you're old enough to remember. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So that was, in retrospect, bizarre. But yeah. So there was definitely fear of thermonuclear weapons. That was, to me, a lot scarier than McCarthy or those people. It was like that we could be in war with Russia. Right. It's a palpable prospect. How much do you think that feeling of, in a sense, a lack of safety and what might have also been a lack of safety in your own home started to form your awareness or your consciousness as you grew up? Yeah. I don't know. Nothing comes to my mind. I think I was genetically liable to wimpishness and impatience. And, oh, I was impossible to please as far as food goes. I was very finicky, just very easily upset. I conspicuously lacked the quality that in Yiddish is called zitzfleisch. This means your ability to just be there. Corresponds somewhat to equanimity in Buddhism. And I was the antithesis of that. My mother tells me I was a difficult baby in the first few years, unruly and just basically impossible to feed and very difficult to handle. My father was away when I was born, so he had never seen me. And he comes back from the Pacific. He's in his uniform. And I may be two years old. I don't know, one year old or two years old, something. And I was just, I like pulled his medals off and I peed all over him and peed all over the ground and jumped in my own pee. And he apparently told my, asked my mother, what's wrong with this kid? So I think I was, I was ugly too. I had like some gross, they cut them off of it. You can't see anything, but I was not, I don't, I think my mother probably cried when she told me, maybe she cried when she saw me. I was not attractive, either in form or behavior. What, if anything, do you know about your father's experience in the Pacific? Well, he, I am reasonably sure he never saw combat. He had, he was a little old to be in the military. So what happened was, I don't think he was drafted. He was just, he, to be patriotic, I think he went to work in the shipyards as opposed to the garment industry. He was a welder, I think. I could be wrong about that. So he was working in the shipyards, but he had some guilt because most men were off. But he was right on the cusp of that he probably could have gotten out of it because he was older. But I think he enlisted so as to not, you know, be whatever. I think he was a yeoman, meaning he handled communication. So I don't think he was actually ever fighting the Japanese. He was just at a job. And all of this is combining to lead me to ask the question that I'm most interested to ask based on everything you've talked about so far, which is, where do you think your interest in Asian culture actually came from? Oh, I know where that came from. That's very well defined, even like literally defined like in a moment of time. So just to get back, so there were great things and not great things in my family situation. That's reflected in the life of my brother. I was going to ask about that. He ended up addicted to heroin and in a life of crime. And, you know, classic sort of story. Later on, he got hepatitis and had a classic near-death experience, dying in an ER or an operating room. I don't know the details. And after that, his life changed and he met this wonderful Mexican-American girl that he married and got his shit together. So in the end, it worked out. But in the later years after my father had died, for a good two decades, she and myself and my brother had a perfectly harmonious relationship, never a ripple. Wow. So it all worked out in the end. And it's ironic because he had been a bit of a racist in his use of language and such. And he ended up marrying an ethnic group that was very much off the radar. And it really worked for him. Amazing. So it worked out in the end, but it was pretty hairy for a while. I'm sure. But anyway, so it was wonderful with the support and the richness, but it was not so wonderful with regards to the emotional. There's a Yiddish expression, machanat simas. It means, like, make a big deal out of it. There's always something to make a big deal out of. So that was not so great, but that completely turned around later, in the later decades, to the antithesis of that, for a variety of reasons. First of all, I went off and meditated. And when I came back, I realized that I was now much more mature than my parents because of the meditation. And it was incumbent on me to not be the crazy one anymore. And I think that had an influence. But then they also were evolving. Specifically, in the case of my mother, she was very linked to our synagogue. And we had a very charismatic rabbi who was a wonderful spiritual teacher. She was also into something called the Church of Religious Science, or science of mind. Our rabbi, Rabbi Trattner, was very good friends with the founder, Ernest Holmes. So the sort of power of positive thinking, combined with engagement in the synagogue and hearing the rabbi's sermons and so forth, turned her life around. And then me coming back from Asia and being a different person, etc., etc. So it was all good in the end. But to get back to your question, where did the Asian connection come in? That's very specific. In middle school, so that would have to have been Webster. Just so happens my best friend in middle school was a third generation Japanese American. And when we graduated, we both went to Venice High. So that continued. What was his name? Gerald Takahashi. And he eventually became a lawyer, I think. So what we had in common was not Asia. We both liked the history of the entertainment industry and movies. And we were part of a club that watched movies. And we studied and read about the film industry and the whole history of movies and so forth. I'd had that early connection because my father had been connected to Billy Gilbert, who was connected to a lot of, even though Billy Gilbert wasn't that famous, his friends were the icons of, even at the transition from silent to talkie, so it was there. And then if you attend a synagogue in Southern California, you have entertainment industry people there, right? So it's in your blood, it's in your genes. So I had that interest in the movies, particularly monster movies and stuff like that. Now, here's a great, just to show you how things go full circle. So that was all initiated primarily by seeing the classic monster movies of the time. And you may know that the franchise of most of those monster movies was Universal Studios. They're even called now the Universal Monsters. All the classics, the Karloff, Frankenstein, the Nogosi, Dracula, what is it, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man. Even back into the silent era, they had Lon Chaney with the hunchback of Notre Dame and Phantom of the Opera. It was the Universal Monsters that created a certain zeitgeist. So here's the ironic part. The two people currently responsible, well, actually, it's a little more complicated, but how can I put it to just not make it overly complicated? The two people who until very recently were responsible for all the Universal Monster productions, which is Jeff Kirshenbaum, who was the production president at Universal who handled those properties, and Alex Kurtzman, who has the Dark Universe and just came out with The Mummy, for example, you've probably seen in the theaters. They're both students of mine. So it's like, okay, you started me out and now it goes around, comes around. So I now have buddies with the people that are the current inheritors of the Universal Monsters. And they're both very committed to practice, meditation practice. So just a funny thing, what the decades can bring. And the universe itself is just wacky sometimes. So anyway, how this happened was I had this interest in movies, and so did Jerry. So we had something in common and something that maybe other people weren't that interested in. So his family used to go on Friday nights to see Japanese movies. Now, just to give you an idea of the how different the cultural landscape was in Los Angeles in the 50s versus now into the teens of the 21st century. As far as I know, there was just one theater that showed Japanese movies. The Toho Libre? That was, this is, I think, before the Toho Libre. Okay. But that was back there. But I may be mixing things up, but I don't think it was that, because Toho Libre was a full-time Japanese movie, right? Yes. What this was, and once again, this is a long, long time ago, so my memory may not be perfectly accurate, but my recollection is that the only place you could see Japanese movies was once a week at some theater, which is where the Takahashis went, and it was in Skid Row, because I remember I was 14 years old, and you'd have to sort of step over derelicts to sort of get to this theater, which was scary for me. Anyway, so I think it was like once a week at this little dilapidated place in the Bowery, you know, if you wanted, and it was only Japanese and Japanese-Americans that went. Well, that would be rather near what we call Little Tokyo before its sort of rejuvenation then. It probably was. Anyway, they had this thing where they would go see Japanese movies every Friday. The movies had English subtitles so the kids could understand. The parents could sort of understand Japanese. They weren't really fluent speaking, but they could speak enough to talk to his grandmother, who spoke no English. So it was, you know, immigrant thing, like my dad, right? Could understand Yiddish, probably was not super fluent, but could get by with the parents. This is a little aside, but just on the use of language. So he's an optometrist, so that's a kind of doctor, and you have to, of course, keep medical records. But he would want to make comments about the personalities of his patients, just to warn him, you know, this one is this, this one is that, okay? And he didn't want anyone to be able to read it, specifically his Gentile secretary. He didn't want her to see what he was writing about the patients, right? So what he did is, he wrote comments in English, okay? But he wrote it in Yiddish alphabet, which is the Hebrew alphabet. So he'd read it in his own language, but he had a complete Jewish education. They went to the synagogue, he knew how to read and write and all that. So he'd write English in the Hebrew alphabet to hide. Anyway, so getting back. So they'd go see Japanese movies. So Gerald asked me, come along. And I actually didn't want to go, because I was not interested in Japan. It was just a coincidence that he happened to be Japanese-American. I was not very favorably disposed, as was the case of a lot of people. Yeah, following World War II. I mean, the war was just a few years ago, right? I mean, it was the Japs. I would never say that in his presence, of course, because I knew that they'd been put in the camps. I'd heard from his parents. I wasn't a racist or anything, but the country of Japan? Meh. But I didn't want to be rude. So I said, okay, I'll tag along. And like I say, it was not an inviting ambiance either. So it was a double feature. The first one was a love story set in modern Tokyo, and it was just boring. It's like subtitles. I'd never had to deal with subtitles. It's a love story. It's just not interesting to me. And the second movie was not set in modern Tokyo. It was set in 16th century Japan, and it was what the Japanese call either jidaigeki or chambara. Chambara is the colloquial. Jidaigeki is the sort of standard term. It means a period piece movie. So it's everything is authentic to Japan. And while it's true that Portuguese had contacted the Japanese historically by the 16th century, the influence was not pervasive. And in this particular movie, there was no hint of any Western influence, no firearms or anything. They had muskets and stuff at that time, but that was not in this. So essentially, it was a view of Japan showing no Western or modern influence whatsoever. That culture as it had been at that time, portrayed by the Japanese, who are the only ones that can accurately portray it. Because when I see Western directors attempts to portray Japanese history, it's like, I don't know whether to laugh or cry, but this is Japanese doing Japanese, so it's very accurate. And chambara means, well actually it's not quite, chambara is the kind of jidaigeki that has a lot of sword fighting and martial arts and stuff. So I'd never seen Asian martial arts and neither had any other non-Asians. There was no interest in this stuff. I can tell you this historical snippet. After I started to go a lot to Japanese movies with the Takahashi family, Jerry and I decided that we needed to learn karate because we knew from the movies that that was the really kick-ass martial art. People knew of judo of course, because it was actually an Olympic sport. So judo was known. Some people knew about jiu-jitsu, which is where judo came from. Now everyone knows because of all things, the Brazilians are the greatest in jiu-jitsu. Go figure, right? Brazilian jiu-jitsu kicks everyone's ass apparently. But some people knew about jiu-jitsu. No one knew about karate unless you were an Asian. But we knew as kids, teenagers, that you could break bricks and really kick ass with karate supposedly. I mean, obviously it's just a fantasy from the movies, but we thought that was the real shit, right? So we searched all of LA. We went everywhere to all the Japanese communities and we could not find a single karate dojo. We found one jiu-jitsu teacher who knew karate, but he wouldn't teach us because he thought it was too cruel and dangerous. So it was impossible to find a dojo at that time anywhere in Los Angeles. Now they're on every street corner in East Overshoe, Arkansas. It's like, oh yeah, Sensei Dojo. I mean, everyone knows these words, right? Everyone. Well, unless you were Asian or Asian-American, no one knew this. So anyway, this was a period piece movie with a lot of martial arts, particularly Japanese sword fighting. And it mesmerized me. Everything about it just mesmerized me. I remember thinking afterwards, well, these people are obviously human beings, like me, but they might as well be extraterrestrials. They're that different. Everything is different about them. The way they cut their hair, this weird thing of cutting a bald spot and then having a chignon. The way they fight. The body language in general. The fact that there's an intense sexual dimorphism. It reflected in all aspects of the culture. It's still true. There's onna kotoba. There's Japanese as spoken by women and then there's Japanese as spoken by men. And so the women have this, asayo de gozaimasu ka? Okay. And the man would say, sono doko? It's like, holy shit, right? So everyone in America, men and women, they talk the same. These people don't. And then their attitudes. It's like, oh, these two samurai are fighting and the other one gets the better and he's on top of the other guy. And he just says, I can still remember it to this day because it was like, what the fuck? He says, you're a samurai. You know what to do. And the guy just whips out this knife and rips open his fucking belly. His own. What is that? What world, what planet is that where you fight someone, you get the better of them, and then you just say, okay, you know the rest, and they rip open their belly? It's like, it's another world. So it was an instant entrainment of fascination. Like you could get fascinated with something like, you know, if you entrain a bird to think of an adult's their parent, it's like it takes a second and they're entrained. It took a second to entrain me into a passionate fascination with that world. So afterwards, I start pummeling Jerry's parents with questions. I mean, what was that? What was that? And then I would hear words, you know, what was that word that sounded like this, you know, et cetera. And they would answer my questions and they could answer, you know, they knew enough. And it's like, whoa. And then the icing on the cake is, okay, after the movie, let's go to J-Town. Little Tokyo on the map, but Japanese Americans, at least at that time, called it J-Town. Is that true? So let's go to J-Town. So Chinatowns had been around since the old West. People were eating Chinese food. I went into the Japanese restaurant. I was the only non-Asian person. I was the only non-Asian person walking down the street. It was another world. And I'm 14 years old. You want to pause for that or we can just, it'll be over. It's okay. We'll just let it go. Yeah. So I was on this huge cultural adventure, like a lot of people's fantasies, which eventually actually become movies where like, yeah, it's like white man's fantasy, right? Somehow I'm the only one initiated into this esoteric culture and I can master this culture. I mean, that was Tom Cruise's movie, The Last Summer, right? It's like some Civil War guy, drunkard, masters all the Asian martial arts in three months. I don't think so. It's a nice fantasy. Yeah. Wow. Well, I was living that fantasy as a teenager. So this became a weekly thing. And it was like, we see Japanese movies. I'd have a million questions. We go out and they showed me how to eat with chopsticks. Most people didn't know how to do that. They showed me how to order food. And names of food. I loved it. I still remember the first Japanese food I ever ate. My God, that's how long ago? Oyako Donburi. You know what it is? It's egg and chicken on a bed of rice in a big bowl. Donburi are big bowls. So and then I learned, okay, that's a Donburi and there's this kind of Donburi and that kind of Donburi. So I knew Japanese food. I knew how to order in a Japanese restaurant. Very esoteric knowledge for that time, unless you were Japanese or Japanese American. And I was gaining that knowledge. And it was this fascinating adventure, really. And I even remember the name of the restaurant where we used to go. It might even still be there. It was called Daruma. And they explained to me what that toy was and what it meant. A Bodhidharma doll from Zen history, right? And it had a picture of a Daruma. So I was getting this cultural stuff, even some Buddhist stuff. And then I had that insight that I got to learn this language. So that took you to the Satel neighborhood. And then that's eventually, I was struggling at UCLA. No, I mean at Venice because you couldn't, there weren't any resources. You could learn Spanish and German and French and Latin. I liked Latin. I took Latin, but no Asian languages. So then I found out about the Nihongo Gakko, for Nikkei, N-I-K-K-E-I. That's the term that is currently used. That term didn't, I don't think that existed in those days, but that means Japanese American Nikkei. So the Nikkei ethnic school that meets after American school on weekdays and on Saturdays. And then I went. And I was, of course, way behind. It was all in Japanese, but I had enough that I could sort of keep up. But by the time I graduated from Venice High, where I was a nerdy nobody, same week I graduated from Satel Japanese Language Institute, and I was one of the class valedictorians. They were showing me off. How many non-Japanese besides you were in this class? Zero. Predictably zero. And probably that would have been the case for a while. And then, of course, everything changed. But it was hilarious because my parents dutifully came to my Japanese graduation. And so I get up there to give this talk. I'd memorized the talk. One of my teachers wrote it for me, but I memorized it. And I look out at the audience. Now, it's mostly Ise, Nise, Sanse. So that means first, second, third generation, Nikkei. So Japanese Americans were to the 50s what Hispanics are to the current Southern California in the sense that they did a lot of the work in the fields. Yeah, and the gardeners. And the gardeners were Japanese American. Our gardener was Japanese American. He was Okinawan, actually. And my parents derived an enormous amount of vicarious pleasure listening to me talk to our gardener in Japanese. So in any event, I remember his name also, George Kaneshiro. Kaneshiro, that's a typical Okinawan. That's not a Japanese name. That's an Okinawan name. Anyone with that name is Okinawan. But they're very assimilated to Japan at this point. The Okinawans is part of Japan. So anyway, so I look out. It's not just that everyone is Asian. It's that everyone has been in the sun their whole lives, okay, so they really, really tan. And my parents had not spent that much time in the sun. And they're Hakujin, which white person, right? So I'm looking out and there are these like pink white faces just glowing in the audience. I remember thinking, oh, now I see. This is why they call us white people. Boy, do they look white. And totally out of place because there was not a single word of English spoken the entire night. But they were dutifully there to sit and watch their boy chick do his shtick with the language. So. So during these years, which you describe yourself as being this nerdy nobody, I think that was the term you used a little while ago. I mean, these are the teen years, these are very sort of pivotal and at times difficult, if not for some excruciating years. Socially speaking, what were those years like? Ours was really awkward. Nerdy nobody is a pretty good description. Terrified of girls and in general of social context. So very withdrawn, I would say. And I enjoyed my hobbies, the language, the culture, whatever. But I think I was not very happy. What about any involvement in what at that time would have been the sort of manifestations of popular culture at that point? Now you went to movies, but what about? Well, I was afraid to drive. Most people in L.A., kids can't wait to get a driver's license. But my concept of myself was that I was poorly coordinated. And so I was afraid that I would have an accident. I took driver's ed, but I never got a license. I mean, I did obviously later in life, but in the teens when kids are really into their cars, especially in those days, kids were into cars and I was afraid of them. And being in Venice, you would have had, I would have supposed, some surf culture as well. Well, I recall that there was a cultural bifurcation between two groups that I seem to remember were called surfers versus hoedads. Does that make sense? Do you remember the term hoedad? Yeah. It meant anti-surfers, right? They'd get into fights with surfers. That's all I remember. What do you remember of it? Oh, well, no. That is something I would have become more aware of later. By studying. But I remember there were those groups and they used to fight. And I used to get pushed around a lot and bullied a lot because I was physically not timid. So I got beat up a bit. I got a knife pulled on me. That was the thing, Venice High, right? That was like someone might pull a knife on you. Not that they'd use it, but they'd like threaten you with it or something. So there was a lot of fistfights and bullying. Like I say, I actually had a knife pulled on me once. That seems so tame relative to the rampages of our time. But at the time, it seemed horrible. It is horrible. So how then did you make this transition into discovering that part of your cultural immersion needed to include Buddhism? And what was your first experience then with what? I read about Buddhism because it was part of the culture. But I didn't believe it, although it was sort of interesting. But it just seemed to entail bullshit. And what kind of Buddhism then? What version were you encountering? Well, the versions that would be related to culture. So just all the different forms, as it would have related to the cultures of primarily East Asia. So that would be Zen primarily. But also other forms of Buddhism, just because I was interested in the cultural thing. Right. So it was a cultural interest. And what caused the transition from cultural interest to an experiential commitment was, I would say, two main factors. But this is moving forward a little bit into the 60s and early 70s. So just to complete the Japanese thing, so I graduated from high school and I went into UCLA as an East Asian language major. Okay. And what year did you graduate? I don't remember exactly, but I think we could figure out from my birth date. So I was in UCLA. I did horribly in all my topics except East Asian languages. I actually got an F in astronomy. I hadn't gotten into the science thing yet. That was later. But it was good because I could study Asian languages and I always got A's in that. So the University of California, as you know, they probably still have it, the study abroad program. So I had my senior year in Japan. Now, most people that they send to Japan don't already know the language, unless they had a very unusual background. So they send you to a university where you can take classes in English. But I knew the language, so I was in just this perfect situation. So what happened was I didn't really attend to classes very much during that year in Japan, which actually is sort of the traditional Japanese thing, at least in that time. Maybe it's still true. Basically, Japanese complete college in high school and then they fuck off. They just fuck off. They drink and they do political demonstrations and make life for the administration of the college hard and are somewhat bohemian. And then the clamps come back on when they go back into the workforce. So I was a standard Japanese student. Saboru in Japanese means to ditch classes. It's actually from the French sabotage. So I would ditch my classes and I would just go out into Japanese society. And I had this magic thing going for me because my face and my voice did not match and my face and my body language didn't match. The voice and the body language and the attitudes were that of a Japanese person, but the face was a gaijin, a foreigner. And that was very interesting to people. That meant I was this rare thing, a foreigner, and most of them had never talked to a foreigner, but they were interested, that they could talk to and relate to. And they didn't have to worry that I would track mud into their house with my shoes or get soap into the bath or something. It was just anathema. So I could go everywhere and I did go everywhere, just everywhere in Japanese society. I could get in because it was so rare. Now, not at all. Now it's completely different. I look at Japanese television. There's endless foreigners speak perfect Japanese, West Africans speaking perfect Japanese. But I was lucky. I was an anomaly at an early period. A novelty. Yeah. So I got by and I just had a lot of perks out of that language knowledge. For example, well, anyway, not to get too far off, but I got pinched by the cops once because I didn't bother to carry my gaijin toroku around the foreigners registry. But when I'm in the police station, I start schmoozing the cops, right, in Japanese. And pretty soon a detective comes and he's interested in me and we're having this whole conversation. And then finally he says, by the way, be sure to carry it next time and you're out of here. I could see the cop that busted me was like, oh, he thought he was going to get this good collar. And this guy just wanted to talk to a gaijin, the detective. We just had a great time. And he said, okay. I said, oh, yes, I'll carry it for now. Whereas I know of other foreigners that were busted that way, it was a big deal. But I could talk my way, charm my way in Japanese. So I'm walking along, but basically what I would do each morning is I would just sort of walk out into the street and see what was going on and just learn about the culture. So I'm walking down the street and I see this sign advertising Sencha-do. So Sencha-do is a form of tea ceremony. You know that. That's pretty unusual that you would know that, but because most people are aware, if at all, they're aware of the matcha-do, which is the Japanese- The powdered tea. Powdered tea that- That you whisk. And that is the Song Dynasty way of preparing tea. Sencha is the successor, the Ming Dynasty way of preparing tea by steeping the leaves, which is the current way that most people in East Asia make tea. There was a older way of making brick tea that the Tibetans still use. That's from the Tang Dynasty. Anyway, there is a tea ceremony based on the steeped tea. And it is associated with a certain school of Zen, the Obaku school that most people have never heard of. If people know something about Japanese Zen, they may know that there's Rinzai Zen and Soto Zen, but there's also Obaku Zen. And it's a smaller school, and it's distinguished not so much by its practice, which is- Well, it has some distinctive features in the practice in that it mixes Pure Land and Koan practice. So that is a little distinctive. But what's mostly distinctive is the cultural background, because the Obaku school of Zen represents the last wave of Chinese influence, cultural influence into Japanese culture. So the history of Japan is a sort of wave form, a pattern of receptivity to continental influence. China, at an early period, China through Korea, but basically continental Asia. And then they'll go through a period where they just close off and they digest, and then they open to another wave, close off, digest, open to another wave. The last wave came at the end of the Ming dynasty, the beginning of the Qing dynasty, when China was conquered in 1644 by the Manchus, who are not Chinese, they're not Han. So that was a big upheaval in China, and some people loyal to Ming fled to Japan, and they brought what would be called modern China, Ming Qing, is modern China. So they brought Ming Qing Chinese culture traits with them, and this way of preparing tea was one of them. So I saw that and it was like interesting, because I always want to do the weirdest thing, the most esoteric thing. And it's like, well, I mean, everyone knows about matcha, but no one knows about sencha. So maybe I should do this, because it's like unusual, even most Japanese don't know quite how elaborate the sencha history is. So I saw this ad, and it was for lessons in tea. So I wrote down the address, this is in Tokyo, when I was a student. And I show up at the house, I wanted, or at this location, I wanted to make a good impression. So as you know, Japanese wear suits. Americans usually don't, but I was Japanese, okay, so I show up in a suit, whatever. But it worked a little to my disadvantage, because the woman that answered the door thought I was a Mormon missionary, because they tend to wear suits. But then I start talking, and I use my best honorific Japanese and whatever, because I could see when I opened the door, she looked at me with horror. She'd never talked to a foreigner. And so I told her that I was interested in this kind of tea, and why, and blah, blah, blah. And it's, oh, yes, come in. Oh, yes, please sit down. Oh, of course, I'll give you the lessons. And here's a dozen nubile kimono-clad girls, and you're going to be the only guy. And yes, oh, you like that scroll? It's 300 years old. Please take it back to America. That kind of thing, right? So that was the good news. The bad news is I'm a klutz, and I was very immature. I was like 21 years old or something, but I was a young 21 and klutzy. So I was not a very good candidate for anyone's tea ceremony, ordinary or esoteric. And she could see that. So she suggested that I spend a month at the headquarters of Obakuzen, Mabukuji it's called. It's in Uji, outside of the city of Kyoto. So I did, and they were meditating. I would see the monks in the meditation hall, and it looked cool. And it also looked like not something I'm up for at all. But it looked cool. But I didn't actually get any instruction or whatever, but I hung out, and what I did is I started to research the history of the Obaku school and all the culture things that came in. No Westerner had ever looked into that corner of Japanese history. And you had to read old Chinese books and old Japanese books, but I could. And they gave me all the resources. They opened up their libraries, these old three, 400 years old books that were printed the old way on woodblock or movable type. So it was culturally and academically very interesting, but I didn't really learn how to meditate. But I got a distinct sense that these Zen monks knew a secret, and they'd be willing to share that secret, but they would never push it on me. There was a moment a moment where this monk had taken me to hear a lecture by Zen master Shibayama. He's actually known in the Western world. His talks have been translated. Shibayama Zenkei was one of the top Roshis of the time, and it was a talk on a text. And it was technical and Buddhist, but I could actually more or less still follow it. And I remember afterwards, this monk just sort of reached out with his hand like this, and just the way he did it, I got this sense that he was inviting me into something, but that there would be no pressure, but, hey, if you want this, we got it. So I just went away with that impression. Then I came back, and now we're in the 60s, and the Vietnam War is raging. And I'm graduating and looking to go to graduate school, and I want to do cultural things. My favorite professor at UCLA, David Farquhar, who was a specialist in Mongol history, came up with this great idea. He said, why don't you go to University of Wisconsin, because they have a PhD program in Buddhist studies, and you've got a strong Asian language background, and they emphasize the language study a lot. And there was money, a lot of money, for a very weird reason. The US had discovered that Buddhism is a political force in Vietnam, with the monks, and they wanted native-born Americans who knew something about Buddhism, and they were willing to pay for a graduate education. The Department of Defense paid for my PhD program in Buddhist studies, three years, a National Defense scholarship, no strings attached. They just wanted people who were loyal American citizens who knew a lot about Buddhism. So I went on a National Defense fellowship to Wisconsin, off to study Buddhism, but once again, still academically. But there had been that initial seed, that impression, just from body language, from that monk, once again, a moment, like a seminal moment. A very Zen, classic Zen moment, in fact. Yes. So what happened was the upshot. I studied Buddhism academically, and I was part of the counterculture. And that had two implications. One is demonstrating, and I was definitely part of that. And you may know that Madison was one of the more fervid hotspots for that kind of thing. I mean, we ran amok in the streets, and someone ended up actually blowing up a building. I mean, it was serious. Right. So I was with the anti-war stuff, like everyone else, more or less. And then the other consequence is drug use. So I spent a couple summers in Haight-Ashbury and used marijuana, and then LSD. So you start to get a sense that there are altered states of consciousness that are possible. So there was that, the drug experiences, combined with that early experience. And then a horrible, horrible tragedy involving someone I really cared about, which we could go into next time. Let's pick that up for the next session. For the next session tomorrow. So all those forces converge to me actually beginning to do meditation practice. Last question for the morning. How did you choose UCLA when you graduated from Venice High? Oh, that's a great question. Well, remember I said how my parents had encouraged my interest? As soon as I got into high school, Venice High, my dad went out and got me a purchased external library card for UCLA. So I could go to UCLA and have access to a college library because Venice High had a pretty limited library. But now I had UCLA. So they got me a library card. And I used to take the bus across town. And so I was used to the campus and used to taking courses. Also, my father enrolled in a cultural anthropology class at UCLA so that I could accompany him. It was a continuing education in the evening. So that was very enriching. So I was familiar. Plus, you didn't have to pay anything. It's a land-grant college. Right. Back then, yeah. Yeah. Always, you have to pay now. Oh, yeah. That's interesting. Well, you didn't then. Right. And the problem was my grades weren't good enough. I really wasn't joking when I said I did poorly in school. So what my uncle found out is that even if your grades are poor, there's this exam you can take that supposedly shows people with, will reveal if you have potential. So I took that, and it revealed that I had enormous potential. Wow. So I went from not able to get in to in as what was called a gifted student. So you got privileges. Wow. So I guess that psychometric was pretty good, at least in my case. It's anecdotal. But it spotted something that no one had seen before. Right. At least in my case, it's anecdotal. But it spotted something that no one had seen. Interesting. That was not evident by my academic record, but turned out to be very, very true. So I took it, and it's like, holy shit, not only am I in, I'm like, now given all these special privileges as a, quote, gifted student. So that's how I got into UCLA. Telling this story, looking back, you can see how grateful I would be to a lot of people. Because if these people hadn't done this for me, or helped me with this, or showed me that, I would not have been able to have the extraordinarily fulfilling life that I have had. So I'm just thinking, my Uncle Jack got me into college, and my friend in school got me into Asia, and you know, it's a gratitude city. Indeed. Well, we'll continue tomorrow morning. Excellent. Thank you very much. Continue tomorrow morning. Excellent. Thank you very much.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.0, "text": " Okay, you ready? Okay. All right.
