{"text": " this material. All right, this is Alex Cline, interviewing Shinzen Young. We're once again in the wonderful home of Mrs. Ann Buck in Pacific Palisades. This is session number four. Good morning again. Morning. We left off last week talking about the interesting and in many ways it sounded like, to me anyway, surprising culture and beyond even the counterculture that had to have been quite present at the International Buddhist Meditation Center during the 1970s when you began teaching there and in fact living there. And I had some follow up questions about that before we maybe hear more about the man that you named and who I only knew from a previous interview as Dhamma Protector. I wanted to know, first of all, what your take was on the reason that you felt that people were exploring meditation and Buddhist teaching during the 1970s. I'm particularly interested, culturally speaking, in what I've often perceived to be a very interesting contrast between the long haired, sort of sensually indulgent culture of that time with this direct meeting with something that could be considered almost the polar opposite of that. So, all the way down to shaving the head, going through very rigorous discipline training, you know, probably the most rigorous in some cases this side of the military. And specifically, I was wondering how much interest there was and how much there was being taught about what we think of as Buddhism per se, or if the emphasis was much more on the enlightenment experience and perhaps answering questions about the nature of consciousness, a lot of which was of course raised by the experimentation with psychedelics and other drugs and things. How would you describe what you saw as the motivation to meditate and to learn about Buddhism back then? Well, as you pointed out, the counterculture movement from the 60s and the 70s, I guess, would sort of be that span, certainly was central to it. One aspect of the counterculture was use of mind-altering substances, widespread use of mind-altering substances. And that got people interested in the possibility of happiness based on states of consciousness as opposed to the only known previous paradigm, which is happiness based on external conditions. Mm-hmm. That's quite a shift, right? I mean, you always had people that were talking about one's state of consciousness being a factor in happiness or perhaps even central to happiness, but I don't think that that achieved widespread mainstream sort of general interest. Or maybe mainstream isn't the right word, but sort of general interest. But the experimentation with drugs, and I did a lot of it myself, so I was pretty representative of that period. I tried everything. I could get my hands on everything, even heroin, speed, and some exceedingly esoteric mind-altering substances that almost no one has ever tried, even to this day. I can tell you stories about that if you're interested. Okay. It's called carbogen. It induces something like a near-death state. Oh, wow. It has to be administered within a medical setting, an operating room, actually. Wow. It's that extreme. I can tell you that whole story if you're interested. Okay. So yeah, I tried a lot. So people saw that there were these possibilities. Mm-hmm. The other aspect of the counterculture was a sort of rejection of the mainstream North American culture as it had existed in our youth. Mm-hmm. So my youth would have been the 50s, basically. Eisenhower's president, things are very different from what happens by the 70s, right? Right. So I saw that transition. So there was the very unpopular war, and so everything got called into question about sort of the norms, and there were the various pride movements, gay pride, black pride, mm-hmm, red pride, what have you. So this is a pretty dramatic arising of values other than the values of North America in the 50s. Yeah. And then so with that, went an interest in Asian cultures and Buddhism and so forth, and you have the Beatles experimenting with Hindu practices. The guru thing really took off. That's right. Of course, it goes back further to the beatniks and their interest in Zen, at least philosophical interest, but probably not much by way of practice. But then people were having these drug experiences and they actually wanted to practice. So the valuing of non-mainstream North American cultures plus the drugs, I think, were the main factors. So people were interested in Buddhism and Hinduism and such culturally because it was part of the valuing of these non-traditional cultures for North America. People were interested in that, but they were interested in experience also. And I think that from the get-go, that caused a real fundamental difference between the Westerners' take on Buddhism and the traditional take on Buddhism in Asia. Traditionally, the actual experiences that come through meditation practice were not the central thing that attracted people in Asia to Buddhism. It was other things, interesting philosophical systems, the prospect of being born in heavenly realms, the possibility of psychic powers. Those types of things were part of what caused Buddhism to spread in Asia. But those factors became not very important in the Western world. So people mostly wanted experience. And it started out with doing traditional Buddhism, but with a lot of meditation. And that is now evolving into something that's sometimes referred to as secular mindfulness or mainstream mindfulness. Neither of those terms is probably a very good term. I would just call it modern mindfulness, which is basically taking the meditation techniques and the goals, but downplaying the belief and the cultural items. And taking only those parts of the practice that are consonant with modern science. So that to me is modern mindfulness. And really, what I suspect is that if Buddhism does end up having a major influence in the modern world, it's going to be in that form, not in the form of Buddhist culture or the Buddhist religion per se. So there's this quote that I have in my book by a Victorian period sci-fi writer, or maybe a little later than that, who wrote War of the Worlds. H.G. Wells. H.G. Wells, that's right. So there's this quote by H.G. Wells. We could look it up, but to paraphrase, it's something like, informed by the spirit of history and purified through contact with science, the original discoveries of the world, and then the discovery of the world itself. With science, the original discoveries of Gautama may yet play a major role in the unfolding of human history. So I'm paraphrasing. We could find the exact quote. But that was almost a hundred years ago that he said that. And that's exactly what's sort of happening. The spirit of history is showing us that a lot of the traditional Buddhist historical claims are not really very credible. You know, belief in a certain lineage being pure or original or that kind of stuff. And then the whole mindfulness movement being, or starting as part of medicine and therefore needing to be scientific, evidence-based, and so forth. So there you have the contact with science, plus the sort of serendipity or good luck thing that the Dalai Lama is very science-friendly. This particular Dalai Lama is always like science and technology. So he's talking to the scientists, and then you have these sort of multiple forces are causing Buddhism to evolve into this sort of marriage with science, which could become a dominant paradigm. We could imagine that happening moving forward. We can't imagine, I don't really see traditional Buddhism as becoming the dominant cultural force everywhere in the world, but a mixture of the parts of the Buddhist tradition that are evidence-based, or that can stand the scrutiny of science and historiography. Those parts do preserve enough to deliver the traditional effects, enlightenment, liberation, and refinement of how one carries oneself in the world. The vijjacarana, the liberating insight and the perfection of the character. Those aspects can be delivered with this other system that takes from Buddhism what is acceptable by the canons of science and logic and evidence, and then co-evolves with science. That could change the course of human history. So from the viewpoint of traditional Buddhism, there's sort of a good news, bad news thing. Bad news is, I think it's really unlikely that Buddhist culture would become the dominant, or would even really have much impact on the world. It wouldn't really have much impact on the course of the 21st and 22nd century. But modern mindfulness, defined as contemplative practice co-evolving with science, that actually could become the dominant paradigm for the whole planet, because it's an unbeatable combination. So anyway, that's moving forward a little bit. How much of an impact, in terms of an encounter, did the arrival of the Vietnamese refugees and their version of what would be culturally Buddhist practice, not meditation practice, have on some of the people who were actively engaged in things at the IBMC at the time? Well, those of us that were interested in Asian culture liked that. And so it just added to the richness. Certainly was not problematic in my experience. I would say it just added to the richness of the whole thing. And now we had more people supporting. And many of the monks that came over, the monks and nuns, were in fact meditators. So it was pretty harmonious. How much crossover was there, or interaction was there, between the Chua Vietnam and the IBMC? Well, the early days, quite a bit. We'd go there all the time. We'd have meals, we'd chant. I would say there was quite a bit of interaction. It was quite good, cooperative. Also, a lot of very important Buddhist teachers came through the IBMC and taught there and led retreats there. Who were some of the ones that you remember as being particularly noteworthy while you were there? Well, did I tell you the story of how I sort of moved into the mindfulness paradigm? No. This would probably be a good time to find that out. So I was, my ordination is Japanese Vajrayana. Yeah, right. But the International Buddhist Meditation Center, although it had all forms of Buddhist practice, it was essentially Vietnamese Zen, lineage-wise. And I'd done Japanese Zen, so I originally was teaching more along the lines of Zen there. So I would give people breath practice, probably that primarily. I can't really remember. And whether I gave people koans or not, I'm not sure. Probably I mostly had people originally just focus on their breath. But the style was Zen. We chanted in Sino-Japanese or Sino-Vietnamese. We did the chants. And if people did retreats that I was leading at IBMC originally, we ate with chopsticks. It was very formal. I carried a Zen keisaku, a waking stick, whacked people. So I was sort of doing the standard Zen thing. I was probably teaching people breath counting, I'm guessing. Can't remember. It's way, way back. So there were two monks that had been in Sri Lanka. They were both Americans. One was named Rahula, who's written at least one book. I don't know if you know him. So we call them Bhante, that's B-H-A-N-T, which is a polite word for a Theravada monk. So there was Bhante Rahula, and there was Bhante Akasa. Akasa was Jewish from New York. Very much both of those things. He'd been in the advertising. He'd been one of the madmen, I guess, New York advertising, whatever. And then his claim to fame in the advertising world was that he created the first ad for a feminine deodorant. And he was looking at his life and saying, is this what my life's going to be about? I was able to figure out an ad for a sensitive thing. And that led him to go to Sri Lanka to become a monk. Now Rahula had another story, but his story is, he was quite young when he went to Asia. He ended up in Sri Lanka also. So they were doing vipassana or mindfulness type practices. They had done those in Sri Lanka, and they were teaching at IBMC. They lived at IBMC as Theravada bhikkhus. And I noticed that their classes were attracting a lot more people, and their retreats were attracting a lot more people than my programs, which were sort of Zen and very cultural. And so I decided to check it out, see what they were doing, and why were so many more people coming to their thing than my thing. It wasn't a jealousy thing, it was more of a curiosity thing. And I saw what they were teaching. They were teaching mindfulness practices, basically observing the senses as they arise in a very systematic way, and in a way with very little cultural baggage. No chopsticks, no chanting fast in Asian languages. So I realized that, and of course I knew that this was based on the original teachings of the Buddha, this preserves the earlier practice. So it was certainly legitimate in my eyes, even though I had mostly done things from the other end of Buddhist history, Mahayana and Vajrayana. So two things struck me. One is that the way that the practice was being presented was quite systematic and rigorous, and sort of had a scientific quality to it. I'm not going to say it was science, but it was sort of science-like relative to the finger pointing at the hazy moon of Zen, where it's poetic and powerful. This was prosaic and carefully crafted. So I saw a spirit of science there, which I take to also be the spirit of the modern world, the zeitgeist. And I also saw that they were not requiring any cultural baggage, or there was very little of that. And it immediately struck me that this is the way to go. First of all, it's legitimate, because it can deliver the same goods as these other things, it goes back to the historical Buddha. But it's much easier to unpack the core experiential component from the cultural matrix, and even the doctrinal matrix, once it arose. And it sort of has something about it that has a little bit of that moving in the direction of what would be a scientific approach. So I could immediately see that it made perfect sense that they're attracting larger numbers of people. So then I started to study with different people working in the mindfulness tradition. I studied with them. I studied with U Silananda, who had been sent over from Burma by Mahasi Sayadaw himself. I did retreats with the Goenka organization, which is based on Mahasi's main competition, the Udakin lineage. I studied with a wonderful teacher named Purnaji from Sri Lanka. He'd been a physician. You can ask Piananda about him. He lived at Piananda's temple. And his approach was quite intelligent and rigorous because he'd been trained. He wasn't one of these people that was a monk since he was a little boy. He'd been a university-trained physician, right? Who then went into Buddhism. So he had a very sharp mind. And was making a personal choice too. Yeah, that's right. Not a cultural thing. So, you know, the family or whatever, you know how it works. So I studied with a range of people. There was also a Thai teacher. I'm trying to remember his name. He's actually pretty well known. Didn't speak English very much. It may come to me in a minute. So I basically studied with Burmese, Thai, Sri Lankan teachers, plus Westerners who had, you know, done that. And that is how I shifted to the mindfulness sort of paradigm. And then over the years, I did more and more experimentation. Unlike my colleagues, say Jack Kornfield or Joseph Goldstein or others, we all went to Asia at about the same time. But unlike them, I did not write a major book until much, much later. So I was much, much less known. And that was actually a choice. I wanted to be under the radar so that I could experiment and make mistakes with innovations without it having big consequences. So I was, there was this succession of innovations that I developed spanning decades, flying under everyone's radar basically. And that culminated in my current formulation that I call unified mindfulness. And basically, I took the mindfulness as sort of the central way of working, but figured out a way to incorporate the major innovations associated with both Zen and Vajrayana, how to incorporate that sort of mounted within the mindfulness framework. And at the same time, have a framework broad enough to encompass the other contemplative traditions of the world, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and so forth. So for me, mindfulness is, I sometimes, that word in English and its translations into other languages, I sometimes call it a trillion dollar word. There's this expression, that's a million dollar word. It's just a very good word. I would say it's a multi-trillion dollar word, because different people will, of course, define mindfulness in different ways. So, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who probably more than anyone is responsible for the mindfulness revolution and the mainstreaming, he usually defines it as, he talks about mindful awareness as present-centered, non-judgmental awareness. However, in private conversation, he'll say that mindfulness is just another word for dharma. Now, and by dharma, I don't think he means traditional Buddhism. I think he means contemplative-based psycho-spiritual growth, as is best exemplified by the Buddhist tradition, because it's in the Buddhist tradition that the meditation experience is most central and most systematic. It's there in Judaism, Christianity, Islam, but sometimes it's more central, sometimes it's less central. And it certainly was never as systematic as in Buddhism. It was actually there in pre-Christian Western philosophy, the Stoics and their offshoot, the Cynics, who were not cynical, by the way. They were idealists, actually. They wanted to bring Stoicism to the masses. Stoicism was the philosophy for emperors and the elite. It was already there in those philosophical systems, but not systematically cultivated. In fact, most of Greek philosophy could be analyzed from a meditative point of view, as they had the right idea, but they lacked one component. They didn't know that attentional skills could be systematically cultivated. That's something India figured out better than anyone. So, because contemplative practice is both central in Buddhism and it's also highly systematic, in some ways we can say that the Buddhist tradition, if you peel away the cultural overlay, which is, as you know in Asia, actually quite thick, but if you peel that away, what you have is the world's most systematic way to cultivate contemplative practice. So, because of that, if we take Dharma, and so John, in private conversation and probably in public, sees mindfulness as being something pretty large, right? And I see it as something being very large. It's essentially a framework within which we can understand all the contemplative meditation traditions of the world. And that's why I define modern mindfulness, instead of saying mainstream mindfulness, or we're still secular mindfulness. John hates that phrase. I'll give you a little inside information. He does not like the phrase secular mindfulness, even though he created secular mindfulness. But if we take modern mindfulness to be contemplative practice, co-evolving with science, so there's a back and forth, that's how I would like to define it. So, over the years, decades really, I've worked to create a system that is a system of practice that is well suited for this marriage of the millennium. It can help the scientists, the scientists can help it, and we can move forward. So, that's what I call unified mindfulness. So, I use mindfulness in that very broad sense. And the unified is that it gives a perspective on all the world's traditions. So, I figured out a way to sort of mount everything, including everything I learned in Vajrayana and in Zen, sort of mount that within a relatively simple unified paradigm. And the most central piece of that is the noting practice from Southeast Asia. So, basically what I've got is a Japano-Burmese, Tibetan fusion practice informed by the spirit of science. And it all sort of fits, fits actually remarkably nicely. But it took decades and decades of experimentation to get to that point. Now, when you were first making this transition, you were teaching still. I was teaching, I was doing the Zen thing. Then I saw what Rahula and Akasa were doing. How did this affect your decision-making about your teaching approach? And how were your students affected by it? Well, they just wanted to meditate, so they didn't care what I did. They didn't miss the Zen stick? Not particularly. So, I studied with all these teachers and I started to give people techniques based on what I'd learned from the Burmese, the Sri Lankans, the Thais, and so forth. But you'll recall that I had met Father Johnston and he had sort of lit this fire about science, and that had happened in Japan. So, the science piece, I would say, there's probably three pivotal aspects or components. One is, I've already talked about, I met the biofeedback guys, Ed Wurtz, David Nolus, Lester Femi. Lester still has a major presence in Princeton, not at the university, but in the city of Princeton, the Princeton Biofeedback Association, I think it's called, or something like that. Lester, by the way, was also a student of Sasaki Roshi for a long, long time. So, anyway, I'd met the biofeedback guys, which was cool. I had actual scientists, so that was an influence. Then there was someone at the center named Tony, and I think his last name was Simmons, but I'm not entirely sure. This was a while back. So, Tony's father, I'm pretty sure, was the head of pulmonary medicine at UCLA. So, he came from a real science family. Tony wanted to learn to meditate, and he was very good at math, which, did I mention I was very bad at? I believe so. We probably talked about that. So, he had a natural ability to do math. I had the opposite of that. But he gave me a very, very good piece of advice when I said, hey, I want to be part of the science meditation dialogue, or science spirituality dialogue. This is before the M word, and by M I mean mindfulness, had come to prominence. Oh, why it's a trillion-dollar word, just to backtrack, because it's a word that's acceptable everywhere in the world right now, regardless of politics or culture, that could be interpreted as meaning contemplative-based practice in the broadest perspective. And then a modern mindfulness, there's MBSR. That's John's system. That's an example of modern mindfulness. My approach, unified mindfulness, is another example of modern mindfulness, in the sense that they've both been informed by the spirit of science. John and I are mutually very respectful of each other. So, it's a really nice sort of situation. So, in any event, it's a trillion-dollar word because it's acceptable across this wide range of areas where humans have a lot of contention, religion, politics, culture. It's very divisive. But mindfulness, in this broad meaning of systematically cultivate and apply attentional skills to all dimensions of happiness, that meaning, that flies. At this point, that flies everywhere. There's no pushback. There might be people that say that mindfulness is overhyped, but that's because the thing that's being taught as mindfulness may often be a pretty watered-down thing. Yeah, rather superficial. Yeah, and therefore, it's true that maybe a certain percentage of what's called, quote, mindfulness is overhyped. It can't deliver the goods. But I would say with great confidence that mindfulness as I teach it can definitely deliver the goods. And by that, I mean it can affect every type and level of the elements of human happiness that are important, including classical liberation and including improvement in behavior and character and so forth. But anyway, be that as it may, so the idea that we could systematically cultivate attentional skills and then apply them to reducing suffering, elevating fulfillment, understanding ourselves at all levels, having more skillful actions in the world, and ultimately a sort of natural sense of wanting to be of service. Those are the five main long-term goals of mindfulness practice as I formulate it. That idea is, as far as I can see, acceptable across the divisions that divide the humans at this point. And it's so, so how much is the world worth? How many trillions of dollars is the world worth? So we can teach mindfulness here at UCLA, and as you know, we do. When I was a little boy, UCLA was called the Little Red Schoolhouse. I don't know if you've ever encountered that. Maybe it's still true. Maybe it's the Little Asian Schoolhouse or something. Very different from my day, although, hey, it's what I saw coming. I went to Japanese school, right? But it is also taught in the Marines and the Army, which is more of the other side of the political spectrum. I and my people have contracts with the Army to help them develop and research mindfulness. So it spans. It is taught and studied in the People's Republic of China, which is an authoritarian and ostensibly communist government, but their Academy of Science sees it as something that's worthy of looking into. And interest in Buddhism in China is growing very fast as well. Is it true? I don't follow those things. That's particularly ironically in Tibetan Buddhism. Well, the Chinese have always had an interest in that. That's been going on for centuries, actually. The strange thing is, I've gotten now several invitations to go to China, and I would love to dust off my Mandarin, but I'm pretty sure that I would teach this as something very not associated with the Buddhist tradition. I mean, obviously, we're going to be honest about its origins, but I would teach it. I mean, my dream is China wants the edge. They want an edge, collectively and individually. That's my take on China. As a nation, they want an edge on the other nations. And every Chinese parent wants their kid to have an edge in terms of education and career. If we could show them that this is the way to get the edge, Interesting. My dream is it would become part of national policy. And since everything is so centralized, it would be the first nation to foster it at the national level. So, I'd want to present things in a way that was very comfortable for the communist leadership of China, very comfortable for them. And it's possible to do it because the form of practice that is consonant with science is consonant with Marxism, because Marxism claims to be a friend of science. So, that's a whole other conversation. But it also, MBSR, John's system, is being taught in Tehran, under the Ayatollahs, which is the exact opposite form of government of the People's Republic of China, a medieval theocracy in a sense. Yeah, right. So, it's theoretically possible that it can fly everywhere under these very different groups of people. Well, that makes it, and since it, with time, will dramatically improve all aspects of the human, the fact that we now have a word for something this deep and powerful that's sort of acceptable to everyone, even Trump's wife, the first time she gave a public talk a few months ago, she talked about children need to learn mindfulness. She used the fucking M word. Did she say that? I couldn't believe it. I thought I heard it. And then when I looked it up, she actually did. President Obama used it too. Well, Obama's sister is one of us. She's a mindfulness practitioner. I know he carries a little Buddhist statue in his pocket that the Dalai Lama gave him. Well, it's close. I'm pretty sure that his sister is a pretty dedicated practitioner. Okay. But here we have at the other end, the first lady in the Trump administration, of all things, used the M word in her first big public talk. I repeat, such a trillion-dollar word. Okay. So, what was the third pivotal thing you mentioned? So, one thing was, well, let me finish up with Tony. So, Tony would talk math at me. I guess that's the way I would describe it. When I started, I did not remember even sixth grade arithmetic. I had to go back and study multiplication tables and basic arithmetic that little children learn. I was that behind. So, while I was still in the stage of learning how to multiply six times six, I mean literally, at that stage, Tony would talk about the beauty of the beauty of homomorphisms between generalized groups or talk about how the concept of the limit is central to calculus and how that is generalized into a whole world of analysis and even further into things like category theory. So, he would talk this upper division or in some cases probably graduate level math. Of course, I didn't know how to multiply six by six. However, I would just sit in front of him and I would merge with him with my practice. I would let go of my inner reactivity, which is, I don't understand this, I'll never understand this. This is gobbledygook. That happens in image talk and body motion, the inner system. I'd let go of the inner system and I'd merge with the sights and sounds of what I would describe as the activity of mathematician. The activity of mathematician. In front of me was the activity of mathematician. Instead of trying to understand it, which would be like me trying to knock out Muhammad Ali, I didn't do that. I used a whole other strategy. I used the Zen merging thing. Usually, our attention is divided between inner seer feel and outer seer feel. There's sights on touch and there's mental image, mental talk and body motion. Usually, our attention is divided between those. But if you let go of the inner world and continuously anchor in the outer world, then you merge with the outer world. You become the other. It's no longer an I-it, it's an I-I, which then with time changes to the I-thou paradigm as you walk through the world. So I would merge with the activity called being good at math, being good at math. Until I had begun to internalize that into myself, I digested it. You can do that. You can digest something from a person. And then I used the practice to deconstruct when my inner system would arise, telling me, well, hey, who are you kidding? You know you can't do this. You can never do this. I would divide and conquer. I would untangle it. I'd unblock it. Until I didn't identify with those beliefs, even though they were based on evidence, my past history of failures. You can look up my records at Venice High and you'll see it was not very pretty. Even my grades at UCLA as an undergrad were not very good, except in Asian languages, where I excelled. But I did pretty poorly in everything else. So the practice gave me three things that I didn't have. It gave me the ability to merge with people who were good at math and science, so I could internalize their doing. And then it gave me the ability to deconstruct and disidentify with my conditioning and my beliefs and my memory about failure in this area. Then it also gave me just generic concentration power. So when I was a little boy in junior high and high school, if I didn't understand what the book said, maybe I'd come back once and I would just give up. But with the concentration power, how do you develop concentration power? The attention wanders, you bring it back. The attention wanders, you bring it back. Like the Bodhidharma doll, it falls down seven times, comes up eight. You just keep coming back. I'd done plenty of that with the breath and so forth. So it's like you don't understand, okay, come back. You don't understand, okay, come back. And I just keep coming back and coming back until I did start to understand. So the practice gave me three strategies for getting good at math and science in general. One is merge with mathematicians and scientists and internalize their doingness. I know it sounds a little mystical, schmistical, but it's just, you can do it. The other is deconstruct the limiting belief that you can't do it. And then the third is more habitual stick-to-itiveness. I'll just come back. I'll just come back. I'll just come back. The Japanese have a proverb, narau yori nareyo. It means, don't learn it, get used to it. And actually John von Neumann, one of the towering figures of 20th century mathematics, said essentially the same thing. Math is not something you understand, it's something you get used to. He actually said that, something like that. So I just kept coming back, coming back, because it was just like meditation. Your mind wanders, you come back. I had that. Zitzfleisch, in Yiddish, zitzfleisch, you can just stay with it. Steadfastness. Yeah. Then I could deconstruct my limiting beliefs. And then I could merge. I have to tell you a story later on about merging with Wino. Oh, okay. Yeah, we're still waiting to hear about that guy. So Tony gave me this very good piece of advice, which was, if you want to be good in neuroscience or these areas that you're interested in, master math. And I was like, okay, I'm going to do that. These areas that you're interested in, master math. Then you can ace any science course. You walk into any chemistry course, physics course, doesn't matter. If you have a very strong math background, you have a leg up on any science course. And it's true even for science courses that are not highly quantified, because the discipline, the way of thinking that becomes habitual if you do a lot of math, which mathematicians call mathematical maturity, that helps you understand any other system, highly formal system. So his advice was, don't worry about chemistry or physics or whatever. Just get really good at math first, and then you can go. So I came to realize that there's this sort of hierarchy of generality and power. I was perhaps interested in neuroscience, but that's really part of physiology, and physiology is really part of biochemistry, and chemistry is really part of physics, and physics is modeled by mathematics. That's the language of physics. So you sort of go, as you go deeper, things, the going gets tougher, but you also go broad. So physics is much broader than just chemistry, right? It's a lot of things. And then there's one last thing on that pyramid of hierarchy, that hierarchy or pyramid of power and generality and challenge. And that last thing is meditation, but I had that. That's the most broad, the deepest, and the most challenging. Because if you have meditation, you can be good at math. If you're good at math, you can be good at physics, and then it goes down the line. So the good news was I had what was at the base, but meditation is much broader than just... It's not just good for academic skills. It's good for sports skills. It's good for social skills. It's good for amorous skills. You name it. So it's the broadest and deepest. So I was fortunate I had that. I used three distinct strategies. I implemented Tony's suggestion to get good at math, and then that allowed me to learn the sciences. And I mentioned there were three things. So one was meeting the biofeedback people right off as soon as I was back from Asia, then Tony and how he tutored me. And then the third thing was I took a course in extension, adult education course at UCLA in computer programming. Now we're still talking about the early 70s here. So there were no PCs. Computer programming meant... Well, what you did is you joined the UCLA Computer Club, and that gave you access to the 360-90 IBM mainframe, which was their pride and joy, at the time the fastest computer on the planet. However, you programmed with punch cards. It's that long ago. And they taught me a language called PL1. So I actually learned a programming language for mainframe computers. PL1 took all the features of ALGOL and Fortran. ALGOL had been for business primarily, and Fortran was what they used to make all the science stuff. So it combined those features into one language called PL1. So it was quite ponderous as a programming language. And one of the things you had to learn, well, the first day, so it was a guy from the computer club teaching this. Now mind you, programming a computer was still something very, very esoteric. The general public did not have any contact with that kind of thing. It was like something for very special people. If you were a computer programmer, it's like, whoa, he's a computer programmer. It's like, whoa, he's a rocket scientist on steroids. He must be smarter than the computer. I mean, people had those sorts of naive notions. So it was very esoteric. But the first day, the guy said, there's nothing complicated about a computer program. There's just three elements and they're woven together. There's sequential processing, there's looping, and there's branching. And I'm going to show you what those mean. And they taught us flowcharting, just the basics of how you do a flowchart. Like a decision tree except it can loop back, right? Tree only branches out. So I learned flowcharting, which teaches you how to create algorithms. So the zeitgeist of the late 20th and early 21st century, our time, is molded by two huge ideas in my way of thinking. One is the advent of the algorithm, the notion of, which is just a formalization of what a program is. If this happens, you do this, and you keep on doing it until this other thing happens, and then you do this until a certain critical value is reached, and then you loop back to where you started. So I learned the power of the algorithm. And I learned to think in terms of flowcharting, in terms of sequential looping and branching process that just keeps going until it converges to, hopefully, to what you want. And so I was very interested in computers. Now Lester and I went to the first computer show in New York, because he knew that the biofeedback equipment needed to be run by computers, which was not the case of the early thing. He was an electrical engineer, so he knew the future was in computers. So this is a few years later, but I was visiting him in Princeton, New Jersey, and we went to New York City. And so a computer for an individual's use, a home computer, as opposed to a mainframe, at the first computer show in New York City, what that meant was they give you a kit and you build a microprocessor. You have to build it yourself. You couldn't buy the\u2026 PCs didn't exist, okay? And the concept of an operating system for a personal computer or something like that, that didn't exist. You had to build the hardware yourself from a kit or a schematic. They'd sell you all the parts, and then you had to program it at the level of like machine code, okay? Or maybe the other thing, what do they call it? I forgot now. A little bit above machine. So you had to sort of build and program your own computer. It was that long ago, okay? But that was the beginning of the personal computer. So I started with holorith cards, you know, the old-fashioned way at the IBM mainframe at UCLA. Then I saw, okay, you could have a small computer that you could \u2013 I said microprocessor, but I guess that's not the right word. They didn't have the integrated circuits yet, I'm pretty sure. But anyway, then there was the \u2013 I remember the first personal computer that you could actually buy ready-made. It was from Radio Shack. I think it was called a TRS-80. Someone at IBMC had one, and it was, holy fuck, look at this. It's an actual computer, okay, that an individual could buy from Radio Shack. I think it had an operating system of some sort. So then I saw that, and then I was actually taken \u2013 one of my students from Colorado took me to the University of Colorado and showed me this thing that they were working on there for ARPA, which is the predecessor of DARPA. That's the science fiction lab for the Department of Defense in the United States, right? ARPANET. They showed me ARPANET. And ARPANET, of course, is what evolved into the Internet. I actually was there. And he said, just wait a few years. This is going to change the world. And what happened was that they developed the notion of a graphical user interface. So you didn't have to clunk, only you put things in, you point and click, right? So the point and click allows for a real-time interaction with the computer that's really quick and really easy. So the computer works by having a complex algorithm, but that's just a very, very big flowchart. The point and click or the graphical user interface that we all use now allows for real-time interactivity. Those two things taken together, the real-time instantaneous interactivity plus the flowchart, the real-time instantaneous interactivity plus the flowchart, have created the information age. So I saw all that happen before my very eyes. I lived that history. And it occurred to me that that's the way we should teach and support meditation. There should be an algorithm, a flowchart, and there should be a real-time interaction with the coach. And that's how we would optimize two things, the acquisition of the skills and techniques, and we could support people in applying them. So I developed a notion that is thoroughly informed by the zeitgeist of the late 20th and early 21st century, incorporates that spirit of the times, and I call it an interactive algorithmic approach to mindfulness. So I find out what the student wants, give them a technique, I'm talking to them over the phone, they could be anywhere in the world, I say, call me back in 10 minutes. When they call back, I say, okay, when you did that, either this happened, this happened, or this happened. Tell me which. And then based on what they tell me, I loop or I branch or I go sequential. And what has taken all the years, in fact decades, is to figure out what the right questions were, number one, and to figure out the ontologies that would allow me to classify the goals, techniques, skills, and sensory experiences that people pass through. So an ontology, as I'm using the word, means a taxonomy with rich clarification of relationships between the taxa. That's what ontology means in information science now, as opposed to the philosophical meaning of the nature of existence. So I needed to create ontologies, that is to say, taxonomies or classifications of the techniques, the sensory experiences that people have, the goals, the reason we do it, and actually the attentional skills themselves. I needed to be able to classify all of those things in very clear ways, taking as a sort of inspiration the periodic table of chemical elements. So I have a periodic table of sensory elements, I have a periodic table of happiness elements, I have a sort of periodic table of all the world's meditation techniques, and I have a way of classifying the skills, the attentional skills, into their basic dimensions. So eventually I did learn chemistry, and then that gave me the idea of creating these ontologies. And then from learning how to flowchart and then seeing how the internet evolved for real-time interaction, I got the idea of creating an interactive algorithmic approach to mindfulness that reflected the most powerful thing that I could see happening in the society around me. So what took me all the years was that I had to create the ontologies that would allow me to know the right questions to ask to optimally guide people. So I eventually figured out a rather extensive list of questions that I ask the student when I give them a technique. And the questions are designed to be a valence-free partition of logical possibilities, with an optimal response strategy for each contingency. So a partition of logical possibilities. When you did that technique, this, this, this or this, exactly one of those had to have happened. And there's no other possibilities besides those. So these contingencies are mutually exclusive, they don't overlap, and they're collectively exhaustive, they cover all possibilities. And it's valence-free. I'm not suggesting that any one of them is better than the other. So that allows me to extract all and only the information I need to, in real time, optimally guide people. So the combination of... So these were the science influences. This spans quite a length of time. See, what eventually happened is when I left IBMC... I was headed towards asking when that happened and what the circumstances were. I don't remember exactly. The circumstances were not that I was dissatisfied with IBMC. It was that a student was willing to buy a house so I could have my own center, and it was in the same neighborhood. We were on Eldon Avenue, we called it Community Meditation Center. I don't remember exactly when this happened. But I'm guessing that it's the early 80s, but that's a guess. So someone bought a house and a bunch of my students lived there, and I would work with them every morning honing this algorithm. But the seeds were planted at IBMC. So that's the genesis of the unified mindfulness system. So, going back to two things with the time we have left, which is about another half an hour before you have to knock off. First of all, one of my impressions is that your volition in this direction, in this area, is extremely strong. To essentially go into the sciences, an area where you historically had a lot of limitations. You mentioned, for example, undergoing a process that sounded potentially rather terrifying, chemically induced state. So it doesn't seem to me there is a lot of fear there either. One of the things I'm wondering about is, aside from hearing the story, for example, about this drug or this chemically induced state that sounded risky, what, based on your knowledge of yourself and your looking back at those years when you were formulating all this, would you say characterizes the strength of your volition or your aspiration or your drive to fully explore and understand these areas? I would say I've always been very curious and I've always been extremely fearful. But I think most people are extremely fearful. When I look within, I see that basically we are all just scared little rabbits waiting for coyotes. So I would say I've always been at least as fearful as everyone else, maybe even more so. Yes, a pretty fearful person. Of course, eventually I had some pretty powerful tools for dealing with that. But I've also always been very curious. So there was a curiosity factor that's pretty strong. When there's my grandiosity, go big or go home, I saw the possibility that I could be part of something that dramatically changed the course of human history for the better. So it's like, that's... The big picture is very big. Yes, yes. It's playing on a very, very big stage. So a lot of chutzpah and grandiosity in my personality. And this played into it. It's actually a positive in this case. Right? And then there was the coolness factor. Because it's like, when I was a little boy, I thought that would be the coolest thing in the world, would be to be a scientist. It's like, that is so fucking cool. So C cubed, curiosity, contribution, and coolness factor I think is what strongly motivated me. Okay. Wow. And so how did you come across this opportunity to experience this drug-induced experience? Well, yeah, as I said, yeah, there's a lot of interesting stories we could talk about. Maybe we can get the... Yeah, we still haven't gotten to Wino yet. I'm not overheaded there. So when I was at IBMC, I had no way to make any money. I was like a hippie, right? People did give me Donna for teaching, but it wasn't much. So I made my money by selling marijuana. Because I knew these criminals who could get me good stuff. Wino and his buddies. And one of his buddies, that guy's dealer, was the dealer of a very, very famous actor who's still alive, so I'm not going to say the name. So I had access to good dope. And I met a millionaire who was paranoid and wanted good dope, and he trusted me. So that was my source of income. I see. He didn't just pay for the dope, he just gave me money, because it didn't matter. He was very wealthy. I was sort of a friend to him. So in addition to good marijuana, there was this thing that he would do every now and again that seemed to help him with some of his issues. By the way, I taught this person meditation also. We each had what the other one needed, and I could help him with meditation and some of his issues. And he had a lot of money. Of course, now I help people recover from addictions. But this was back in the crazy days. Yes. So what this thing is that he found helpful is, well, the substance is called carbogen. You've never heard of it. Most people haven't. It's sort of one of God's little jokes, because most of the molecules that are psychoactive are actually fairly complex, except for alcohol. That's pretty simple. But the psychedelic drugs and whatever have pretty complex molecules. The narcotic molecules have complicated rings and what have you. But this substance is incredibly simple, carbogen. In fact, it's not even a chemical compound. It's just a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen. So when you breathe out, that's what comes out. Well, you take in oxygen, you breathe out CO2, probably some oxygen with it. So these are atmospheric gases, right? I guess carbon dioxide is CO2. Well, that is a compound, that's right. But then oxygen is just by the diatomic molecule. So basically we breathe in air, which is mostly nitrogen, but it contains also a significant amount of oxygen. Then we breathe out CO2, and that powers the oxidation-reduction reaction that is life for animals. Plants reverse. So way back, probably before World War II, I think, there was a doctor named Medina, in the psychiatric field. Now I guess there was a time when they were trying convulsion for schizophrenia and things like that. It's still used for depression. So it was known that if you give a person a mixture of pure oxygen and CO2 in the right proportion, that it will cause them to convulse. So they were looking into it as an alternative to some of the other things that they did with electricity, chemicals, whatever, to cause convulsion to help the brain presumably reset in some way. So they were experimenting, and he claimed that this helped some patients. Those claims, I think, were pretty much debunked later on. But I don't know how it happened, but people started to notice that this induced a pretty dramatic altered state in a healthy person. So what happens is that it has to be done in a medical setting, because it's very radical. Because essentially, if I were to put a subjective interpretation on it, objectively, well, that's a different question. But if I were to say, what does it feel like? Well, you start breathing this stuff, and then you do start convulsing, violently convulsing. And you have to sort of pass that point, and then there's this cutoff where you're not convulsing at all anymore, and you're in this other place. Now, I've never\u2014because I've been out of the drug scene for decades and decades, right? So I've never tried some of the stuff that my students tell me about. 5-MeO-DMT or ayahuasca is really popular now. I've never tried the more modern things. I never tried\u2014what do they call that?\u2014ecstasy. All that came after my period of being a stoner. But I'm going to guess that certainly nothing that I had as a psychedelic, acid, or any of the other things, or even remotely approach this degree of alteration. So if I were to describe it from a first-person perspective, once again, biophysiologically, I don't know. It'd be interesting. I could look into it. But from a first-person perspective, it seems as though the CO2 has convinced your brain that you're dead, but the O2 keeps you alive. So it's a near-death experience on demand for as long as you want. So there was one doctor in the United States that would provide this experience for you. He had the same name as the\u2014should I mention this? I don't know. I mean, this is like 40 years ago. Is there any\u2014am I going to get someone in trouble? Any chance these people are still alive? I sort of doubt it. Well, let's not say the name. We'll just say he's in New York, was in New York City. I sincerely doubt if he was already older at that time. But I don't want to get anyone into whatever. So he would provide this. In his office in Manhattan, he had essentially a small operating room. You were hooked up to all the monitors, and you were given IV to\u2014a combination of things to keep you alert, Ritalin for one thing, IV, and also things to cut down on possible anxiety. I forgot what was in\u2014you got an IV cocktail. And then you were given an extensive battery of physical and psychological tests before they would do this. So this experience cost thousands of dollars. So this is a millionaire's thing, okay? He wanted me to have that experience. So he paid for my\u2014we went to New York City. He wouldn't stay in any place but the Waldorf Astoria, like any other\u2014it was a little OCD about things. So I had my own room in the Waldorf, and he gave me a pocketful of money just for\u2014because, hey, you're going to need it in the city, go here, go there. That may have been the first time I was in New York City, and I was still pretty young. So I had a pocketful of money. I'm staying at the Waldorf. And I'm a hippie, a Buddhist hippie. So I did it. He did it. And it was a whole afternoon. It was hours and hours and hours. And basically, after all these tests and everything, you lie down, they give you the IV thing, and this mask come over, and it's like you're in the Bardo, but without any hallucinations, just vast, eternal, empty, sort of near-death-on-demand. So that definitely trumps any other drug experience. Other people might\u2014some people claim that 5-MeO-DMT sort of does that, but it doesn't for about five minutes. This is hour after hour after hour. So that was an unusual drug experience. Carbidgen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, that simple. How much, if any, impact did that have on your view of things? It's hard to say. In the end, no drug experience even begins to hold a candle to the cumulative effect of meditation. What you were saying at the end of our last session, this period also put you in the realm of the criminal, and you mentioned this person. I described my first meeting with Lee Wino. I don't know how far we got beyond that. One of the things I wanted to know is you recognized him as somebody who had had essentially his own sort of\u2014 No self-experience. Yeah, because when he took off his glasses\u2014because he was very intimidating, right? I had been a total wimp. I used to get beat up all the time in school when I was a kid. And now it's like he was not himself in the Hells Angels, but he was in a one-percenter club. So the Hells Angels are probably the highest status one-percenter club. The one-percenters are, in their definition, it means we're the one percent of the bike-riding population that are really dangerous and tough. You said that you recognized this, and you also mentioned today that you had an emerging experience with him. What do you know about, or what were you able to sense about how he arrived at this? Well, I think I might have mentioned that he knew he was going to be incarcerated because of a lifestyle choice. So he figured he would study and meditate when he was behind bars, and then I think the phrase he used was, when he was out, he would run amok. So although he only had an eighth-grade education, he had a graduate school level of vocabulary. And that was amazing to me, to think that he was self-educated. And he'd had some sort of breakthrough experience, I think, in San Quentin, meditating in his cell. And he could quote obscure Zen masters from Japan, and he had an understanding. So here's someone who couldn't in a sense be more different relative to me. A tough guy, like an authentic tough guy. Like, okay, you see it in the movie, well, it's a little bit different being in the actual, the true presence. But very intelligent and very knowledgeable about Buddhism, of all things. He could hold his own in a graduate level of conversation about Buddhist ideas. Because I knew, because I did that, I was at that level. So it's like, whoa, this is a real rarer avis, a rare bird that has these things. So we sat down on the front lawn, and he pulled out this really cool-looking little pipe, and he pulled out this vial of dope. And he told me the story about how he had snuck that dope out of Hermosillo State Prison, stuffed up his ass. It was the best stash he'd ever had. And he only shared it with special people. See, they have this way of ingratiating. The psychopathic personalities, they can be very charming. And, you know, it's like, I'm glad I had this experience, actually. Because it gives me a sympathy for people that go down the road of joining a gang. When I see that on television, I understand why. I understand the attraction, the sense of belonging and affirmation. Because that's what, you know, he wasn't recruiting me to be in a gang, but he was recruiting me, in a sense, to be a hang around. So you can see this, actually, on the Sons of Anarchy show. If you watch that show, you'll see that from an outlaw biker's point of view, all of the world is divided into four groups. There are club members, and you're supposed to have a very special relationship with them. Then there are prospective club members. Then there are what are called hang arounds, or people known to the club. And for whatever reason, they're comfortable with you hanging out. And then there's everyone else, which is, of course, almost everyone. With everyone else, I would strongly say you don't want to be around these people. Even as a hang around, you could still get the shit kicked out of you, but at least you're, you know, it's much less likely that's going to happen. I was going to say, you have less of a chance of getting kicked out of you. Yeah. If you follow the rules, they probably are not going to molest you. So you're not a hang around until you know the rules. And there's lots, you know, there's things that are just no-nos and whatever. So to be a hang around, you have to have something going that they want. Maybe you have something in the world that they need, you know, a connection, whatever. In my case, it was the fact that I'd actually lived in a Buddhist temple. That was something most people hadn't, and it was like, cool, they could show off this guy as like, hey, you saw Kwai Chang K'ing on television, but this guy really did that, you know, kind of thing. So it was a little bit, there's some cachet associated with my having done that. And some of them were into the martial arts. See, this is the shift that took place in American culture. The bikers originally, the original, even the name Hell's Angels comes from veterans after World War II that had been in the Hell's Angels, you know, the Air Force and so forth. Now the war's over, they're coming back, and they're looking for that camaraderie that they had in combat. And they're, a motorcycle club would be a \u2013 It's the tribe. Yeah, it's a natural, you know, I got your back, I'm going to die for you, that kind of relationship. And of course, it was booze, you know, that people drank. So the bikers started out with booze and downers, second all, and alcohol. But then like everyone else in the 60s, they got into psychedelics. And you know who was mostly responsible for that was, what was the guy's name? Dowsley? No, the Pranksters. Oh yeah, the Mary Pranksters. What was the name of the guy? He invited the Hell's Angels to be turned on to LSD. And thinking that that would move them in another direction from booze and second all to more psychedelic kind of thing, I'll remember the guy's name. Because actually some of the people I met had been in on that first party with the Pranksters where they were turned on to acid. So anyway, so they got into psychedelics, and then they get into martial arts, which is an import from Asia. So now we have what are essentially redneck thugs who in the 40s or 50s would have been one thing, right? But even they changed. And now it's more psychedelics, we're doing Asian martial arts, so there's a little bit of that Asian thing going. And so I had the Asian thing going, right? So then I was a hang around, I could be a hang around. So this was a chance for me to explore another culture. So I'd done China, I'd done Japan, I'd done the Jewish thing. We haven't even gone into that, but I did have a Jewish upbringing, which I'm very grateful. Very grateful for two things. One, that I had a Jewish upbringing, went to synagogue. And two, that I did not develop, how can I put it? The us versus them attitude that you can easily develop if you belong to a group like that. I totally dodged that bullet. Never had that, but still had the cultural and personality molding things that go with growing up as a Jewish person. Being part of that society. Yeah. But I dodged the bullet of the it's us versus them and they're always out to get us kind of thing that a lot of people do actually have. But I never had that. So I had the best of both worlds. I always did. So I had the Jewish thing, I had the Chinese thing, I had the Indian thing with Sanskrit that I didn't do. I was still actually in high school. And the Japanese thing. So it's another culture. It's the criminal culture. And some of them were bikers and some of them were just straight up criminals. So I met, we became really good friends, Wino and I. Really, really good friends. And he introduced me to his friends. And one of them was Hank, who was the bail bondsman for the Hells Angels. And he had the bail bonds office that was right across from the Hollywood police station. Right there near Ivar, Vine, right in the heart of Hollywood. There was the police station. So all this shit that goes down in Hollywood with people getting arrested, this was the omphalos mundi, this was like the belly button of the underbelly of Hollywood. Okay. Right next to Hollywood Boulevard. Hank's office was right across. And you never know if these guys are telling the truth or not. But he said he was half Jewish and half Italian. He certainly had mafia friends. They would come by. And I used to hang out there. And for a wimpy little LA Jew boy, that was quite an environment to be hanging out in. Of course, I knew how to play it cool, because I could use my meditation skills. All you have to do is just not be an asshole. Just play it cool, be respectful. So I would merge with them. I would give them good vibes. And I never got beat up or threatened or anything, but I got to see the criminal world from the criminal's point of view. And I got to see the gang world from the gangbanger's point of view, not the ethnic gangs. In fact, this is the other end of the spectrum. Hells Angels, and you see this actually on the Sons of Anarchy program. One of the reasons Wino did not join the Hells Angels is that they're racists. That's part of their doctrine. And he wasn't a racist. He didn't have that. But it's whites only and they always are looking for trouble with blacks. I don't think I heard the end word was incessant with those people. Just incessant. So Wino wasn't like that and obviously I'm not like that. But I could still, it's okay. I can be accepting of their non-accepting. Wow. And there's an interesting seeming total disconnect here with the breakthrough realization, sort of an awakening, and the absence of what we might think of as the elements of the Eightfold Path. So for example, right livelihood is one of them, or at least the ethical side of it. Well, here's the thing. See, in Wino's point of view, the bikers were the modern American analog of the ronin. The ronin are masterless samurai who go around looking for adventure and may think of themselves as protectors of the people in their dreams or whatever. So his way of thinking, he was a ronin and he modeled, his club was called the Righteous Bastards. And it was very Asian in its whole gestalt. Oh, sort of its iconography. Yeah, that's right. And they had the Taoist yin yang thing as part of their, so that's why he would never join one of the real one-percenter clubs, because they're sort of racist and he wasn't that way. So you want to hear about merging? We're up into your time limit. Well, Christian's not here yet, so. Okay. I do, before you go anywhere, I do need you to sign the legal agreement. I'll sign that. I won't leave before I sign that. I need to take a little photo of you. There's Christian. So I guess, to be continued. To be continued.
