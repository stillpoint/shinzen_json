{"text": " Hey there, it's Juliana and I am extremely excited today because it is the official launch day of the Foundations program. We are rolling and I couldn't be more excited about it for a couple of reasons. I know that there is really nothing like this out there right now and I know that for two reasons. One, Xin Zhen's framework, the depth of it, the scope of it, the clarity, the precision, the thoroughness. He has done the work for all of us, both in terms of having a breadth of experience in his own training, being familiar with so many different contemplative approaches, having a scholarly approach, so understanding world contemplative practices on that level, having a scientific rigor because he partners with hard science to do research around practice. So that gives us a tremendous framework to lean on and it makes our job as trainers so much easier. So there's that. But then there's also the fact that, and maybe actually this is connected, there's the fact that in this space right now you either have to take a deep dive into practice, go whole hog and get certified and spend years in training and years in the certification process, which is totally amazing and honorable. But the flip side of that is there really isn't anything other than that track. So anybody who is in a helping profession and would maybe like to, for example, a psychotherapist offering it as a complimentary practice for their patients, not their main thing, but something they'd like to share because they think it would be useful. So anyone basically who's in a helping profession or in a position to share it who would like to, they're on their own. You don't really have any kind of framework to lean on. You have to just kind of watch other teachers do it and gather from that how to do it yourself. There isn't anything out there right now that speaks to you if you are either kind of less experienced or you're in a helping profession and you want to offer it just as part of what you do or even if you're more experienced, but you don't necessarily want to take a deep dive into a full-on certification program. So I'm excited because this offers you a framework so that you can get the support you need in offering other people this training. And lastly, it helps you go deeper with your own practice because you bring that level of clarity then in order to be able to tell someone else about it, you really have to know what's going on inside you as you do your practice. So very powerful on all those levels. Very happy that we've made this available. And today is the opening day. So check it out. We have some wonderful bonuses that are only available for the next seven days. So those bonuses are designed to support you even more. And you can read about them below. And I'll look forward to connecting with you more on your journey in guiding others and deepening your own practice. And we will connect again soon.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0200000000000005, "text": " Hey there, it's Juliana and I am extremely excited today because it is the
