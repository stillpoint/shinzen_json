Executive summary is that you have a kind of, let's see, that you realize that there is no thing inside you called a self. Sometimes that realization happens suddenly and you can read about that in books like Three Pillars of Zen. They've got all these testimonials in there about people for whom it happened really suddenly. But it's my experience that it usually sneaks up on people. Sometimes they don't realize, quite realize how enlightened they've become because they gradually acclimatize. But the Buddhist definition of enlightenment is that you realize that there's never been a thing inside you called a self. Now, there is certainly an activity inside you called a personality.
