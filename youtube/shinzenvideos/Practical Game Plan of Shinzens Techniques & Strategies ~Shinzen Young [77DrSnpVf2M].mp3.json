So I outlined this in the What is Mindfulness, what this whole strategy is. So the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right off the bat. So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of concentration kind of thing, but they're explicitly developing concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity, and they're learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights can arise without us trying to get them to believe a certain thing. So we're going to provide you with an attentional skill set, we're going to provide you with a way of analyzing your sensory experience, which is, it's not any doctrine or belief system, it's obviously is the case that we see and we hear and we feel. And then people can hopefully start to have really significant experiences.
