{"text": " So, I had some interesting questions that people gave me. So one was, is there anything like Shaktipat in Buddhism? So how many people know what the word Shaktipat means? Just curious. Not as many as I would have thought. Well, Shakti is a Sanskrit word meaning energy, and pat means to fall or confer. So Shaktipat is a sort of zap of energy that you get from a teacher, often within a Hindu context, but I think it could be generalized from that. Usually done in some sort of ritualized way. The most famous example would be students come and the teacher touches them with a peacock feather or something like this, puts their hand on them, looks at them, does something to cause Shakti to arise within that person. So the question is, is there Shaktipat in Buddhism? And that actually can be answered in a whole bunch of different ways. First of all, Shakti is related to Kundalini Shakti. So where does that fit in Buddhism? Where does this energy, which is sometimes expressed in terms of heat, sometimes expressed in terms of a movement of the spine and so forth, where does this notion fit in terms of Buddhist practice? Well, the simple explanation is, it's an aspect of what I call flow. And what I call flow is just my way of talking about impermanence. So there's two ways that people can relate to impermanence. One is, well, it's what happens when you bring a lot of concentration, clarity and equanimity to ordinary sensory experiences. Then they present themselves in a wave paradigm as opposed to a particle paradigm. So there is no special energy separate from any ordinary experience. In other words, the so-called materiality of the world, the carnality of one's body, the somethingness of one's mind, all of these just turn out to be what happens when you don't have a complete experience of seeing, hearing and feeling. And when you have a complete experience, which is just another way to say, have a very clear, concentrated and equanimous experience, when you have a mindful experience, in other words, beyond a certain critical value of mindfulness, those ordinary experiences become extraordinary. They show you their wave nature as opposed to their particle somethingness nature. So there's no energy separate from what is ordinary. Or a metaphor that might be taken from Einstein is he said that matter is just frozen energy. So ordinary sensory experience, inner and outer seeing, inner and outer hearing, inner and outer body, that's just flow, that's just energy that has been coagulated by what? Well, it's been coagulated by incomplete experiencing of it. The other way to relate to the energy thing is that there's this energy and then there is, in contrast to that, the material world. And then the goal is to somehow get beyond the material world and to get to this energy which is desirable. And that leads to a rather different paradigm, which is that, well, there are ways of manipulating this energy and causing this energy to be transferred and enhancing it and so forth. So certain traditions like Kundalini Yoga, Qi Gong, Nei Gong in China and so forth, they sort of work from a perspective of, well, there's this thing called Shakti, there's this thing called Qi, it's this energy thing and we cultivate it, we manipulate it, we work with it and make it stronger and stronger and we can actually use it for doing stuff. That's one paradigm. And I think that's a legitimate paradigm. There's nothing wrong with that. Then there is the paradigm that I would use, which is that there's sensory experience and Qi equals MC squared. So by fully experiencing the materiality of things, the non-materiality becomes evident. Now there's nothing to say that a person couldn't work within both of these paradigms. I was once at a conference of Western teachers with the Dalai Lama and someone asked about mixing practices because a lot of Western Buddhists and a lot of Western Buddhist teachers have more than one lineage that has influenced them. So the question was put to His Holiness the Dalai Lama and he said, well, it's okay, but you just, when you do one practice, you do that practice and in the afternoon if you do some other practice, then you do that practice. So as long as you can understand the complementarity of them and use each system as its own system, then that's okay. So there's nothing to say that you couldn't do Kundalini yoga or Qigong, which involves manipulating the quote energy, and also do Vipassana, where you're simply paying attention to what is and if flow becomes evident, you have the option to pay attention to it. And yes, indeed, the more you pay attention to it, the more prominent it becomes. That does tend to create a feedback loop in that way. So Shakti, so now we know the Shakti part, what that means. So is there transference of energy from a teacher to a student in Buddhism? And the fact is, in Tibetan Buddhism, yeah, big time. And it's formalized as initiations and there are whole ceremonies built around it and so forth. So yes, there certainly is that structure within certain parts of the Buddhist world. But what I like more is the way Shakti part is done in the Zen tradition, at least in Rinzai Zen. I'm not that familiar with Soto Zen. Soto Zen is a little different. In Soto Zen, the Roshi sits with you, and in Soto Zen, you face the wall, but the Roshi faces out and sees everyone. So that means everyone that's fidgeting or doing whatever, it's eyes open practice, right? Now I guess in some sense, maybe this is a little bit of a Buddhist guilt trip. It's like, maybe you're not going to fidget so much because you know you're impacting on the Roshi's see out. But you get uncomfortable enough and lost in your own misery, pretty soon, I don't think that guilt trip really helps very much. People do move and fidget and whatever. And so the gift of the Soto Zen Roshi's is that they just take in all of that and metabolize it as part of their sitting. But it's done in the Zen Do because that, but the cool thing is you've actually got not just a Roshi, but maybe a bunch of Roshi's sitting with you in the Zen Do. In Rinzai Zen, as far as I've ever experienced it, the Roshi doesn't go to the Zen Do. You go to the Roshi, but you have one on one interactions in which you are given koans, which you've all heard about and I've talked about. So that one on one interaction with the Roshi is in fact Shaktipat, but it's never talked about that way. You either catch on or you don't. So in the interaction while you're on the surface seemingly working on this koan, at the depths that master is grabbing your belly button. And how do they do that? Well, some of you may remember the teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda. So it's about this anthropologist from UCLA that goes to Arizona and starts to work with this Yati Indian and loses all objectivity and gets sucked into that culture's way of experiencing things. And this is true. It actually happened. It's like a really interesting and cool story. So in the first book, at one point, this anthropologist, Carlos, asks Don Juan, which is the fictitious name of the Yati shaman that he worked with, whenever I'm around you, all this weird shit happens. What is it? And he said, you're just seeing the power of my not doing. Now when I read that, I understood. I don't think the anthropologist understood. Not at that time. It was just another mysterious, weird thing that this guy said. You're just seeing the power of my not doing. Those Roshis, they don't do anything to grab your belly button. In fact, it's the opposite. It's their emptiness that's grabbing you. Their pure doingness. The fact that they are a flow, whether they're laughing or whether they're bawling you out, it's just wind of nature. You pick up on their body language, you pick up on all of those things, and that is indeed Shakti. See, that's sort of the difference between Vipassana and Zen. There's a lot of differences. I mean, obviously they come from different cultures, historically, etc. But practice-wise, a gross oversimplification would be that in Vipassana you observe sensory experience until you realize its impermanent nature. Maybe that's as far as you go, or maybe if you're lucky, you go beyond that to not only experience the senses as flow, but to actually ride on the flow, meaning that the bounciness of the void starts to speak through you and move your arms and so forth. You might say that that's impermanence affecting the motor output in addition to the sensory input. So in Vipassana you work with the sensory input, and some Vipassana teachers it affects their motor output and they have that bouncy, liberated quality that you get in Zen. But other Vipassana teachers it doesn't affect the motor output and they're more inert, I guess would be the way to put it. Whereas in Zen, this is like, once again, don't get me wrong, this is a gross oversimplification, but in Zen they first train you to, they train your motor circuits into how to flow with impermanence. It's the Zen schedule. And it's the whole energy of the interaction that you have with the Roshi, who's like moving in certain ways and then you find yourself moving in those ways. So you're sort of training your output to flow with expansion and contraction, and then hopefully at some point it will go beyond your motor circuits and start to infect your perceptions of self and world so that your senses begin to flow with expansion and contraction and you get liberation. So it's almost like they do the same task but in opposite order to a certain extent. So that for me is a kind of Shaktipat because the Roshi is conveying the activity of emptiness, the Buddha nature, the activity of impermanence to you. And it's not talked about but if you know how to pick up on it, then you carry that with you back into the Zen dome. So the difference with this kind of Shaktipat versus the Hindu formalized ceremonies or the Tibetan formalized ceremonies, the difference is first of all it's not talked about that way. You either pick up on it or you don't. And there's no formalized ceremony, ostensibly it's just you interacting with this weird person and doing these weird things. So I like that because there's not all this, I don't know, specialness about it or what have you. But what I really like about it and once again what represents a very significant difference from say the normal Shaktipat thing that you get from some Baba, okay. I'm not dissing it, I'm just trying to describe the situation. Normally what's going to happen, you get your Shaktipat from the Baba and then what happens after that? Well you all eat prasad, you sit around, you chant bhajans and everybody feels great and you all talk about how great the Guru is and then you leave and when you need your next fix you come for your next fix. However in the Zen formal Shaktipat you go in, you have this incredible experience with the Roshi and then what? Then you go back to the Zen and if it's in the winter it's not heated and it is freaking cold. If it's in the summer there's no fan and there's mosquitoes and it's hot and you just want to sleep but they'll beat you and yell at you and essentially you're going back to the samurai torture chamber. And there you get to test to what extent you have truly metabolized the Shakti. And you now apply it to the samurai torture chamber. So that the goal here is to create equals, not disciples. Every Guru worth his mala should want equals, not disciples. For real, not lip service, for real. In fact as I implied yesterday every Guru worth his mala or her mala should want students that are better than them. End of story. So that form of Shaktipat you got to use it. You got to use it for something real, aching legs, sleepy head, emotions running up the yin yang because you're being abused all day and it's pushing every button that can be pushed. Okay, now how real is that Shakti? Can you experience that as flow? And that's how that Roshi got to be the way they are and so it goes. So yes, there's that kind of Shaktipat in Buddhism. And then there's the daily Shaktipat that we all have now, don't we? Because we're always sharing energy with each other. Everyone. To the extent that a person has a practice to that extent the people around them pick up on that. And so you're all giving Shaktipat to other people whether you're aware of it or not. It may not be as powerful because number one, people don't necessarily have the expectation and the expectation is of course a big part of it. And number two, well your Shakti might not be quite as intense as someone that's meditated 80 years in a monastic training but you got something, okay. And you're also getting Shaktipat from other people. And in fact, this is going to sound a little weird but you get it from animals who very much are in the flow and you get it from your children until they develop a talking self. In the first few years of life, what does infant, infant in English, infance from the Latin infance, which is the present participle of fari which means to speak. Same root as confabulate and so forth. So the infant is the one that doesn't speak yet. Has not acquired external language, has not presumably acquired internal language but there's a certain magic period there where the, when you're attending to a neonate and so forth or I don't know how far the magic extends on average but you know probably, you know the first year at least, where basically your infant, your child is a Roshi. They are just space expanding and contracting. And if that's then parenting, every time you take care of a baby, I think nature intends that to be a sunset, a Shaktipat for the parent to recharge their batteries which are strained to the max by the parenting endeavor. So that's, you know, there's that. Yeah it's interesting about the no self, the not doing, this is a really weird story. Okay, they tell me that I'm supposed to tell stories. So that's supposed to make a good Dharma talk. This is a true story. So many years ago I was driving through Santa Monica with a student of mine who has since passed away. I don't know if any of you remember about Martinez but anyway, this is way back there. So we were driving in Santa Monica and we had this weird psychic experience. It was like a truly psychic experience. So we're driving down the street and we both started to look at this homeless person who was, they were just on the street corner and it was evident that there was some mental illness there. But they were just sort of like, you know, just sort of like moving, okay. And we looked at this guy and we looked at each other and we knew that we had had exactly the same thought and it was true. And the thought was if you clean this guy up, put white robes, put him in front of a group of people and don't let him say anything, people would have Shaktipat. And that's a fairly complicated thought. Because there was just no self there. He was just part of nature. Now apropos of stories, years later I was at another student's house and so I see this book and it's one of these like photo books, you know, that people would put on like a coffee table or whatever this was on, her piano. And I'm hesitating now because I'm trying to remember the exact title of the book, unfortunately. I don't plan these talks very much, so. Okay anyway, it's a picture book. It's just pictures. It's like this huge book of photographs. And I start to look through these photographs and what's interesting is that there's nothing by the photographer, the person that's the author of the book. There's nothing at all. But what there is is an intro, a preamble by Toni Morrison. Now that's a fairly important person in the world of art and literature and so forth. So that tells you, well this is somehow a significant book. But there's nothing by the person who actually took the photos. This is anything about anything at all. In other words, the photos have to speak for themselves. This is big book, okay. And I'm flipping through this book and I'm like freaking out because it's very evident to me, these are all portraits by the way. It's very evident to me what this book is about and that I had never seen a book like this ever. And so this is, I think some of you know Markel. This is at Markel's house. So anyway, I go to Markel and I say, but this book is amazing. And she said, well, you know Bergman, the guy that wrote it or that photographed, I guess we lost our power. The photographer is a distant relative of mine. So I say, well, can you get his telephone number? He said, sure, I got his telephone number. So we called him up and he was there. And I said, I told him what I thought his book was about. And he freaked out. And he said that I was the only person who ever understood what the book was about. Of all the people that, you want to check this out? Of all the people that had seen it in exhibitions or whatever. So now I'm sure you're quite curious as to what it's about. Now, damn it, I don't want to get the title wrong. Let me just see if I can find it. You're surfing the web. Yeah. This is a good day and time. Let's just try here. I was going to do something else with the internet than this. I'm very klutzy and slow. I don't think that's going to work. You got it working? Okay. Let's see if we find it. Okay, I found it. That's just amazing. Here it is. And that gave them time to get this fixed. Untangle and be free. People don't like the divide and conquer, so I gave them a more politically correct way to say it. So it is by Robert Bergman. The name of the book is A Kind of Rapture. So what it is, is he went through the rust belt of the United States, the old decaying cities, photographing street people who for whatever reason, usually a combination of a hard life and physical and mental illness, had been thrust into a no self state. In other words, people for whom the blows of life had driven them to a no self, a rapturous no self experience. He went around the country looking for those kinds of people, catching them at the moment where they manifested the non-ego that their hard life had taken them to. And you get picture after picture after picture so that the message, you know, you see one or two pictures like that, it doesn't have the same impact. But if you see 50 pictures like that, then it hits you what the whole thing is about. So the reason I thought it was so extraordinary is that although there's a lot of books about enlightenment or no self coming about through practice, and there are a number of books of people, written by people that have had spontaneous enlightenment experiences, what no one's looked at is this whole thing, this whole other aspect. And so it's, in terms of its subject matter, it's very unusual. And then in terms of the, so the message is very unusual and the medium is unusual. Instead of writing a book talking about this phenomenon, he shows it to you. And you either get it or you don't. So anyway, that's a whole other little riff, but apropos of where you might go for your Shakti Paschal.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.4, "text": " So, I had some
