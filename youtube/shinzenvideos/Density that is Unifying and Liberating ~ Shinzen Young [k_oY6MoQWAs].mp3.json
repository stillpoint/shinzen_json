{"text": " So we're talking about, okay, I said, I actually contrasted spacious versus dense. So for me, dense just means not spacious. Okay? Now here's where it gets, where you have to be really careful about words, and this is exactly the point you brought up, which I was wondering if anyone would bring up, actually. So good for you. When you get into very highly concentrated states, you can get a sense that things are thickening or getting, quote, dense, but it's pleasant, and it's unifying and also liberating. That's contractive flow. That's another flavor of contractive flow, the feather-like paper. See expansion and contraction are technical terms. Oh, what about technical terms? Okay, they have very specific meanings. Expansion and contraction in my system cover a huge range of sub-flavors. The lightness, thinness can be parsed as contractive. That jonic, sort of, quote, density could also be parsed as contractive, and they're both pleasant and liberating, just in different ways. So that's what I have to say about that. Can you maybe compare and contrast the sense of heaviness and thickness, sort of, getting into a certain state versus the quote, unquote, badness, the thickness in a sensory language? Well, one obvious difference is that the quote, bad density hurts like hell, whereas the good density really feels good. That's an obvious difference. The reason for that difference, if I were to put it in words, is that the quote, bad density comes about from resisting the contractive force, whereas the quote, good density comes about through deeply surrendering to the contractive force. There's not that subtle cellular rigidity against contraction. And the good density is actually halfway to global gone. And global gone is a big deal. Global gone is the ninth jhana. That's sit there for a week and your breath stops. Except you don't die. I mean, your breath obviously doesn't completely stop, but you know. That's sort of waxy catatonic physiological trance. That's good, if you're fortunate enough to be moving in that direction.
