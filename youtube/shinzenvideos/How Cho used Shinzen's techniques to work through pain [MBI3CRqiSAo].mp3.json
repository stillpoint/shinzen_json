{"text": " Can you give an example of maybe a specific way in which you used the techniques for any specific issue? Yes, I found out recently or in the last couple of years that I am either allergic to codeine or it doesn't like me, whatever. And I was having some back issues and my doctor prescribed codeine for me in a Tylenol 3. And I had said to her, I don't think I can take codeine because years ago when I was experiencing gallbladder problems, I started having extreme stomach issues with it. And she said, oh, that was probably your gallbladder. Well, it wasn't. In the middle of the night, my stomach went into an extreme spasm and I immediately started doing my practice. It escalated and yes, it became much more difficult. I actually sent my husband downstairs to get a CD that was how to deal with pain or like I wanted Shinsen to guide me. And while it was extremely difficult, I think it really, really helped. I spoke with him after that because even after my years of meditation, I thought I could do better at it. But he was very kind and said, you know, until some of these really, really big issues hit us, you don't know what you would have been if you didn't have the practice. Can you give an example of what you specifically did on that night? I did two things. I did the focus away from the pain and I also focused on. I needed both. Shinsen's techniques, when you're focusing away, I was looking for restful spaces within my body, within my talk space. I was focusing away from the pain by trying to find the relaxed rest spot so that the pain wasn't so intense. And then when it would get to the point where the focus, I had to focus on it, then I was using focus on the pain and I was watching the intensity, the shape, whether it was sharp or dull, whether it moved, was there a color to it that I could focus on to sort of, and that, you know, that allows the pain to spread more and be less intense in one area. That's what I did. I ended up going to the emergency anyway, but. Everything worked out. So, yes, it's a coding, something you just have to work out of your system.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 19.0, "text": " Can you give an example of maybe a specific way in
