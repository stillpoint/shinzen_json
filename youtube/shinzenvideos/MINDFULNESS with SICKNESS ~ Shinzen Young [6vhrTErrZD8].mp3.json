{"text": " So, I'm aware that some people are dealing with the challenge of being sick and so forth. Well, it's interesting, in a Zen temple, being sick, they have all this special vocabulary for everything. Ordinary things all have their own sort of like special things. So, they don't say byouki, which means the normal Japanese word for being sick. They have this expression byousou, which means the symptoms of illness or the appearance of illness. So, instead of saying this monk is sick, they say this monk is showing the form of sickness, like the appearance of sickness, byousou, meaning of course there's a little bit of an implication that there is a sensory experience of being sick. And then that is a form, a manifestation. The implication of course being that eventually you want to be able to escape into the sensory event of being sick, the byousou. And the Japanese, there's another word in Japanese that there's just no English equivalent, which is narikiru. Narikiru means you deal with it by totally becoming it. You so become it that everything else is cut off. Naru means you become. Kiru means you cut. So, you so become it that everything else is cut off. You utterly achieve oneness with it. Or a more idiomatic expression in English might be complete commitment. There's a complete commitment to just experiencing being sick. Now the good thing is, the lucky thing for us, is if you are sick, I'm going to encourage you as much as you want to sleep and rest and take breaks and so forth. But in the Zen temple you're not allowed to do that, no matter what. You have to follow the schedule no matter how sick you are. And that is really misery. I didn't get sick much, but every once in a while. We got inoculated against Japan encephalitis because you get bit by mosquitoes, right? And oh man, I had a reaction to the shot. But it's like there's no mercy. You just have to keep doing the schedule, right? No matter how you feel. I'm remembering now. I'd forgotten. That was very unpleasant. It was summer too. It was like hot. Of course, a lot better than getting Japan encephalitis. But anyway. So yeah, there's actually a long tradition of using the sickness for your practice. But here, you know, you have the luxury that you can take it easy if you need to. But even when you're taking it easy, try to make you not begrudge the fact that, oh, I got sick now, I can't have a retreat. That is the retreat. And in daily life, injury, illness, visiting the hospital. Whenever I work with students that they're calling me from the hospital, I'm having this operation or that thing going on, I say, I always have a stock phrase. I say, okay, you're having a non-consensual retreat. You're being forced into a situation where there's nothing to do but explore the prospect of happiness independent of conditions. Because this condition is going to go on for a little while. Before there was Chan, or as the Japanese call it, Zen, in China, there was Tantai. That was the first meditating school of Chinese Buddhism. And that was actually at a relatively early period before the Tang, during the Sui dynasty is when that started. And then it gained momentum in the early Tang. They came up with a very interesting way to meditate. The lineage did not survive, though, the lineage of practice, although the texts have survived. Other lineages like Chan or Zen and Pure Land and so forth survived in China, but Tantai didn't, although it has been preserved in Japan. It's called Tendai in Japanese. The reason I'm mentioning it is that the first meditation manual that I'm aware of in the Chinese language was written by the Tantai Dasher, the master who created the Tantai system. It's in 10 chapters and it's called the Moha Jurguan, which means... Moha is actually a Sanskrit word incorporated into Chinese. It's Maha, which means big, right? Or great. Jur means in Mandarin means to stop. And Guan means to see or observe. So the great stop and see. So stop, it translates Shamata. And see or Guan translates Vipashana. So before there was the word Zuochan in Mandarin, which is Zazen in Japanese, that's the normal word in Chinese and Japanese for meditate. But before that word existed in East Asia, the word for meditate was Jurguan, which means to do Shamata Vipashana, to do calming, concentrating, but also observing insight mixed together. In any event, before I practiced meditation, I was an academic studying it, a scholar of it. And I was fortunate because before I even got interested in Buddhism, I was literate in both Chinese and Japanese. I could read those Asian languages fluently. So all my early study of Buddhism was done actually by reading books in Chinese and Japanese about Buddhism. And one of the books that I read was this manual by Tiantai. It's something that was written in the 7th century AD in China. So it's like over a millennium ago and half a world away. But you could sort of have an intimacy with the person that wrote this by reading what they had to say and reading about their struggles. The reason I'm mentioning this is 10 chapters, and just like I attempt to do, he very systematically lays out the nuts and bolts of practice and relates it to various scriptures, particularly the Lotus Sutra was central to this particular school. So one of those chapters, it's an entire chapter devoted to just the whys and wherefores of practicing when you're sick. It was a long time ago that I read it. I don't remember the details, but I remember thinking, oh, Tiantai must have himself had a lot of health challenges and it must have been very difficult for him to achieve what he achieved. And that's probably what's motivating. This is probably based on his own experience. So it's like a whole section, it's like a tenth of the book. The first meditation manual in East Asia is about not begrudging the fact that you're sick. But okay, you do this, you do this, you do this, you do this, here's how you can treat illnesses. I seem to remember now there was some Chinese medicine in there. I also seem to remember that there was some Taoist magic in there to sort of make certain kinds of spirits cause certain kinds of illnesses and you can militate against them with this or that. I seem to remember that, but mostly what I remember is the notion, okay, you're going to get sick. That's just an opportunity for practice and don't begrudge the fact and just don't lose a beat. Use it for your practice. So you know how you can do that within the context of what we're doing, you apply a technique. Basically if you have a sensory challenge, there are two fundamental strategies and you can, there's plan A, plan B and you can alternate plan A and plan B. Plan A is turn towards it, untangle, unblock, not acute, totally become it. How do you go beyond hot or cold? When it's hot, you boil to death. When it's cold, you freeze to death. You just become it. So that's plan A. I call that strategy turn towards. Now when you take a turn towards strategy, you need concentration, clarity and equanimity to do that successfully. The flip side of that is by attempting to focus on it in a systematic way, you will develop concentration, clarity and equanimity. So it's an exercise in those skills. So you are developing those skills, but now you're also applying those skills to deconstructing or having a complete experience of whatever the sensory challenge is. Plan B is turn away. So turn away would be in terms of possible focus range. Well, you could, let's say that the challenge is the physical discomfort of an illness. So what is the sensory gestalt for physical discomfort? We talked about it in the group process this morning. There's the uncomfortable physical sensation and then there's the reactivity of the inner system to that. The uncomfortable physical sensation will often resolve into one or more local intensities and then a more subtle global spread. Subtle is significant. So you've got local intensity, global spread in feel out, the physicality of the body, and then you have the inner system, mental image, mental talk and body emotion reacting possibly to that or being impacted by that. So that's five sensory elements, local physical discomfort, global physical discomfort, mental image, mental talk and body emotion. So you can work with the parts, you can work with the whole, untangle, unblock. That would be to focus a turn towards strategy. What's a turn away strategy? Well, anything that's not that. So you could anchor insights and sounds. Sometimes when I work with people who have severe chronic pain, acute chronic pain, the only thing they can do is they just have to get away from the mind and the body because the mind and body are just untenable. The only thing they can focus on is sights and sounds. So anchor out or maybe you can access restful states. See rest, hear rest, feel rest, or maybe you can nurture positive image, talk, body, emotion. So an alternative strategy, plan B, is turn away. Now there's a tendency to think that if I turn away that's denial and suppression. Unfortunately there's also a tendency to think if I turn towards that's just going to make it worse and reinforce it. I think you can see that if you buy into those two beliefs you literally have no place to turn. You've set yourself up for abject suffering. So what I would like to encourage people is to consider that in fact both of those options are viable strategies. Why? Because the turn away also entails concentration, clarity, and equanimity. Your ability to do it depends on those skills. On the other hand, the attempt to do it builds those skills. So you're developing and applying the same skill set. Concentration power, let's say you're anchoring in sight and sound because the mind and body are untenable. So you get pulled away from sights and sounds so you keep coming back. That's concentration power. Sensory clarity, well the sights and sounds might be subtle relative to the intensities that are going on in mind-body space. Well that ability to detect subtle things, that's a sensory clarity. Or specifically when you're working on restful states, see rest, hear rest, feel rest, typically the restful states are quite subtle relative to the activations. But you're developing sensory clarity by the ability to detect. Remember sensory clarity has two, depending on how you want to look at it, three sub-dimensions. Resolution power, the ability to distinguish. Sensitivity, the ability to detect subtle signals. Those are different things. They both come under clarity. If you want to make it more complicated but also more traditional, you can say there's another aspect to clarity, what the Seyedahs call penetration. So, okay, one aspect of clarity is detection. So the ability to detect subtle things may be involved, probably will be involved in a turn away strategy. And how about equanimity? Well, your willingness to allow the sensory challenge to expand and contract in the background while your attention is focused in the foreground on something else, that's background equanimity. So, like I say, I like to divide the skills not only into dimensions but sub-dimensions. So the ability to open up and turn towards, that's one kind of equanimity, foreground equanimity. The ability to turn away but at the same time open up in the background, that's actually a related but independent skill that I call background equanimity. And I encourage people to develop both of those equanimity skills. Now we've talked about concentration, the ability to hold something small, but also the ability to hold something large, the ability to hold one thing for a long period of time, or the ability to taste momentary concentration on a variety of things. These are dimensions within the clarity skill. So I'm going to say that if you elect a turn away strategy, that you are developing and applying the core skill set. If you elect a turn towards strategy, you're doing exactly the same. So if you think about it this way, it's a win-win situation. Either strategy is legitimate. And what you want to avoid is the lose-lose situation, which is, I don't want to turn away from it because that's just denial and suppression. I don't want to turn towards it because that's going to just exacerbate it and reinforce it. So now you have nowhere to turn. So anyway, if you happen to have a sensory challenge of any sort in general, and specifically if you're struggling with an illness at a retreat or that kind of thing, these are some things you can keep in mind. And so when you're in the meditation hall, try to be aware of your breathing that may come about through sleepiness or through some discomfort that you're going through. Open your eyes, straighten your spine, etc., etc. Most of you know this story, but this is how I learned about that a lot of times you don't realize how disruptive you might be. So I'd been meditating for, I don't know, maybe a year or so, and I went off to this Soto Zen temple called Antaichi. And so this is one of these Soto Zen, so you meditate facing the wall. I was already a Shingon monk at the time, so that means that I was wearing robes. And underneath, so you have sort of these robes, but they're not very thick. And then underneath that you have a kimono. And it's a winter kimono, but kimono is not really designed for cold weather. Okay, it's great for the summer, the air just comes through, you know. But I was really, really cold. And I was sick. I got sick in the middle of the thing. And I was really, really miserable. And, you know, no heat in the zendo at all, right? And it's like winter. So I guess I didn't realize it, but I was like...all day. So like, the second day of the session, you're facing the wall, right? You can't see anything behind you. And I go to sit down and bang, someone punches me in the nose from the back with a Kleenex stuck to my nose. And I couldn't see who it was. I guess the only word that I can think of is Vesuvius of Rage. All day long. It just over and over again. How dare that motherfucker. I didn't know who the motherfucker was. It was someone, almost certainly a Japanese monk. So now I've got all that going on. And you can't do anything. You just have to face the wall and face yourself. I mean, I got the message, okay, you know, dude, you've been an asshole. You've been sniffing this whole time. So now I, okay, I won't sniff anymore. But oh my God, I was so angry and so uncomfortable. And there's just nothing you could do. It's Soto Zen, it's 50 minute sits, 10 minute walk, 50 minute sit, 10 minute walk. I think they did 14 hours of sitting each day, something like that. And you're facing the wall. No talks, no nothing. It was hardcore. It was shikantaza. It was like just sit. And there's nothing to do but just face that inner hell and deal with it. Which is sort of awful, but not nearly as awful as not dealing with it. Some of you have sweated with my friends Wolf and Lisa, the traditional Native American sweat lodge. So anyway, it's Lisa that does the really hot sweats. She's full blood Lakota Sioux. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. And we were in a sweat once and she was saying, I know this path is hard. I know this path is hard. I know this path is hard, but there's one thing harder than this path. Harder than doing this path is not doing this path. And it is so true. So, you know, I could have been the person that wasn't miserable and sick and beat up in Japan. I could have been not that person. That would have been so much harder. So much harder. I think I mentioned in the last retreat, maybe I didn't, but an acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% Happier, Dan Harris. He's on the nightline, right? And I think ABC, Good Morning America or something like that, right? He's like a talk hoe, but he's one of us. He famously had a panic attack on camera at some point in his career, which you can actually see it's on YouTube. It's like, we'll be there forever, right? And that was his wake up call that he had to, something was radically wrong with his life. And a major part of his recovery was to take on this practice, mindfulness practice. But because he's in the position of being a prominent television personality, it's sort of cool for us. So he wrote this book called 10% Happier. And he's got a whole program that goes with it. Actually he's partnering up with one of my facilitators, Jeff Warren from Canada. They're on tour now in the US, sort of bringing the message of mindfulness. It's so cool that we're that mainstream at this point. Anyway, the title of that book got me thinking about my own life. So, you know, 10% Happier. And I started to calculate in my mind, did like a thought experiment. Okay, at my current age, what would the picture be if I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 to, by hook or crook, meditate every day of my life? What if I hadn't done that? What if I'd just been one of the million other things that I could have been as a non-meditator? So where would I be, given who I was at 25? Extrapolating, where would I be? And then where I know myself to be as the result of that decision. And objectively, I just, I had to say, it's not 10% happier, it's 10 times happier. I mean, objectively, easily 10 times happier. Or put the other way, I would be one-tenth as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable. So anyway, I encourage you in that regard.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.0, "text": " So, I'm aware that some people are dealing with the challenge of being sick and so forth.", "tokens": [407, 11, 286, 478, 3650, 300, 512, 561, 366, 6260, 365, 264, 3430, 295, 885, 4998, 293, 370, 5220, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.32720314938089123, "compression_ratio": 1.3333333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.07291340827941895}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 17.0, "end": 26.96, "text": " Well, it's interesting, in a Zen temple, being sick, they have all this special vocabulary", "tokens": [1042, 11, 309, 311, 1880, 11, 294, 257, 22387, 10184, 11, 885, 4998, 11, 436, 362, 439, 341, 2121, 19864], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.32720314938089123, "compression_ratio": 1.3333333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.07291340827941895}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2696, "start": 26.96, "end": 34.68, "text": " for everything.
