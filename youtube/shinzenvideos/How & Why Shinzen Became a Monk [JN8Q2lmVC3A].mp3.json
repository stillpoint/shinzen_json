{"text": " So you were ordained a monk at Mount Koya in the Xiong'an tradition, right? Correct. Is that something you always wanted to do since you were a kid? No, not really. What I always wanted to do since I was a kid was be a samurai. I saw in the 50s Japanese samurai movies when I was in middle school. And I just got fascinated with the whole Japanese culture thing. And that led to my learning the Japanese language in LA, going to Japanese ethnic school in addition to American public school. And that got me to Japan in my senior year at UCLA where I was an Asian language major. And I encountered real-life Buddhist monks, but my interest in them was just because it was the closest thing to ancient Japan that still exists. In other words, in the temples, I mean they have telephones and electricity and all that, but it's sort of like the old days, right? So I was fascinated with it. That would be the closest that I could get. Did they have swords? No, only the wisdom sword. So I was hanging out in Buddhist temples just to sort of live as close as I could the fantasy of ancient Japan. But I wasn't meditating because that's the last thing in the world I had a proclivity to do. I was scattered and impatient and wimpy and all those things. So I was just hanging out, having fun in the temple. But I had a sense that they knew a kind of secret that they would be willing to share, but they would never push on me. So when I got back to the United States, I was graduating from UCLA and I thought, well, I want to go to graduate school. I want it to be related to Asia. I'll study Buddhism because you need a lot of esoteric languages for that, and I was good at languages and so forth. So I was going to become an academician, a professional scholar of Buddhism. I passed my prelims for a PhD at the University of Wisconsin. So they sent me back to Japan to do research on a topic. I decided to pick the Shingon School of Buddhism, which is the Japanese version of Vajrayana practice, also known as Tantric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism. I chose that because although many Westerners at that time were studying the Tibetan forms of Vajrayana practice, no one knew about or was studying the practice as it had been preserved in Japan for a thousand years. So I thought, okay, I'll make this my academic bailiwick, my specialty. I'll be the expert in the Western world on the Japanese version of Vajrayana practice. So I went there with that in mind, with that goal. But when I got there, they wouldn't teach me anything because it's for self-transformation, not just as an intellectual curiosity. So they said the only way that I could learn it is if I was willing to become a monk and live in the temple. So in order to be able to write my PhD thesis, I... You became a monk just so you could write your PhD thesis? Pretty much. But what happened is that my motivation shifted once I started to live in the temple and once I started to get some instruction in the practice, I realized there was a huge potential there for me personally. So they were very clever. They put me in this situation that turned me around. And then something happened, something happened in my personal life that pretty much blew me away emotionally and pointed out to me the absolute necessity of seeing beyond the body and the mind. And that happened while I was in that first year that I was a monk there in Japan. And that just changed everything for me. When I was in graduate school at Wisconsin, my hero was my graduate advisor. His name was Richard Robinson. And he was an intellectual giant, just an intellectual giant is all I could say. He could make puns in three languages simultaneously. His specialty was Buddhist logic. Yes, there is something called Buddhist logic. It's Aristotelian syllogistic logic that was used in the Madhyamaka school of Nagarjuna. Somewhat along the lines that the Greek Zeno school and so forth used logic to sort of show people beyond the world. What's beyond the world? Anyway, he was a master of that. And while I was a monk, I got this letter from the United States. He had been injured in a bizarre and horrific accident. A fuse blew out in his house and he went down to change it and there was no source of electricity. So to light, he struck a match and there had been a gas leak there and it went up like a soccer torch and just burns all over his body and horrifically, if he had lived, he would have been horrifically deformed. He just suffered in agony for a month and then died. I thought to myself, what good is all that knowledge? What good is all that intelligence if this can happen at any time to a person? That made it real for me and gave me the motivation to want to see beyond the limited identity with the body and the mind.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.200000000000001,
