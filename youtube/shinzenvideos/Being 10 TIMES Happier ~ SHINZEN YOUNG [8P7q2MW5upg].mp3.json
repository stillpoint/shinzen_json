{"text": " An acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% Happier, Dan Harris. He's on the nightline, right? And I think ABC Good Morning America or something like that, right? He's like a talk hoe, but he's one of us. He famously had a panic attack on camera at some point in his career, which you can actually see on YouTube. It's like, we'll be there forever, right? And that was his wake up call that he had to, something was radically wrong with his life. And a major part of his recovery was to take on this practice, mindfulness practice. But because he's in the position of being a prominent television personality, it's sort of cool for us. So he wrote this book called 10% Happier. And he's got a whole program that goes with it. Actually, he's partnering up with one of my facilitators, Jeff Warren from Canada. They're on tour now in the US, sort of bringing the message of mindfulness. So cool that we're that mainstream at this point. Anyway, the title of that book got me thinking about my own life. So, you know, 10% Happier, and I started to calculate in my mind, did the like a thought experiment. Okay, at my current age, what would the picture be if I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 to, by hook or crook, meditate every day of my life? What if I hadn't done that? What if I just been one of the million other things that I could have been as a non-meditator? So where would I be, given who I was at 25? Extrapolating, where would I be? And then where I know myself to be as the result of that decision. And objectively, I just, I had to say, it's not 10% happier, it's 10 times happier. I mean, objectively, easily 10 times happier. Or put the other way, I would be one-tenth as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable. So anyway, I encourage you in that regard.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " An acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% Happier, Dan Harris.
