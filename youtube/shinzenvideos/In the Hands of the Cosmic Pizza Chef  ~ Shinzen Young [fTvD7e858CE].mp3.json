{"text": " So what did you say? You said that there's like this thing that it only wants one thing. It's like monotonic. It knows nothing, it's a force, and it's a command, and it's one command only, and it's be everything. And it doesn't respect any normal distinctions that we make, either normal ones that humans make or the ones that we make when we construct the techniques. Like, okay, we're going to distinguish visual, auditory, semantic, inner and outer, active, restful. This doesn't respect any boundaries. All it says is, you could say it a million ways, live, get big, be everything is not bad. And there is its complement, it's exactly the same, except it says exactly the opposite. It says die, it says get small, it says be nothing. And no sooner is one present than the other is present. That's what you... You made a certain spatial metaphor of like, okay, you know, you're pushing from this side, it's pulling out from the other side. That particular physics metaphor might not be the right metaphor, but it's the right general idea. They generate each other. A man feels more masculine in the presence of a woman and conversely, they sort of generate their own contrast, right? So you're absolutely correct. We represent complementary flavors of nutrition and we're like babies. And we want to be... Sometimes we want to be held by daddy, sometimes we want to be held by mommy, sometimes we want to be held by both, sometimes we want to just crawl off on our own. But as long as we can know that we can have all of those on demand, then all of our needs are satisfied. So this is the adult version of perfect parenting, I guess we'd have to say. The adult is now the infant, right? Mommy and daddy are perfect parents from their perspective. Now from the baby's perspective, well, that's another story. Because most of the babies aren't even aware that they've never lost their cosmic mommy or daddy. So you get the sense that they kind of want to tear you apart. Like a kid who doesn't understand, like, why do I need to eat? I'm crying, I'm suffering, why are you trying to feed me? It's sort of like, strange. Well, it is absolutely the case that expansion and contraction will tear you apart. It's like being in the hands of a cosmic pizza chef, just being stretched and pounded. And in the process, the lumps get worked out. And it does feel like you're being torn apart. But then as you get used to it, it feels like the paradigm shifts from the forces of life and death are tearing me apart to I am giving myself back to what I'm giving back what I got from father. I'm giving that back to father. I'm giving back what I got from mother to mother. So it's Donna, but it's what you originally got from them. Everything inside of you that says yes joins the cosmic yes. And everything inside of you that says no joins the cosmic no. And that's the yes and the no that's big enough to mold this or any conceivable universe. And then you become that. You become that for a moment or a longer duration depending on practice, et cetera, et cetera. So at first you think that the forces are tearing you apart. I guess we could say there are two basic phobias, claustrophobia and agoraphobia. It's too small and it's too big for humankind to bear. But then when we get over that phobia, the paradigm shifts from father and mother are tearing me apart to I'm giving myself back to father and mother to I am participating in the activity of father and mother and have everything I could possibly need forever.
