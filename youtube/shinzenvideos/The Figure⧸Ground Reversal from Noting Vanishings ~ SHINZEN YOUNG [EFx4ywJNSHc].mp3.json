{"text": " I have a question about just now. I have been doing that practice a lot the last few days. And at first it just sounded very fulfilling and rewarding noticing bad things. And I guess starting yesterday and more so this morning, more and more I am attracted to vanishings where the intervals are shorter and shorter and shorter. You mean the intervals between the vanishings get shorter? No, no, no. Either hearing or seeing or feeling where you are getting closer to a vibration. Well it started yesterday where I would be hearing intervals, for example, in a bird chirping where it would begin with I could mentally know gone and then something so fast where I could barely mentally know gone. And ultimately I am aware of gone-ness because I can hear the vibration and the chirping but I don't have the sensory clarity to know gone. Well, that's your sensory clarity that you are aware that there is this continuous gone-ness and then every once in a while you get more noticeable macro-gones that will punctuate the continuous micro-gone. So that is your sensory clarity is to be detecting that in addition to the macro-gones occasionally. And that's something that I refer to in the manual as the figure ground reversal. That's what's beginning to happen is gone is less something you are observing and more something that's always there and it's the observer that's coming and going. That's a huge shift in one's practice. That's basically the shift from observing the self to manifesting the self. That was my next question. I was in the Pacific before the break. I was noting gone on a, I don't know if it was in the room or in my ear, but basically a vibratory hum in which I could detect gone-ness again until I noted it and it felt more like presence than absence. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Right. That's exactly, that's the figure ground reversal that I refer to in the manual as one of the possible things that can happen as you're doing it. Basically the intervals of something-ness between vanishings, they get shorter and in between there's less and less something-ness until if there's anything in between the gones it's just both. There's in-out flow, gone, in-out flow, gone, in-out flow, gone, and the cleft is like the black hole. It polarizes but it just then re-collapses to the black hole and doesn't decide to do a big bang and make a universe..", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.0, "text": " I have a question about just now.
