{"text": " I understand that you have some programs that are based on your techniques that have started to be employed in various places. And I wondered if there is something that you can share with us about what's happening with aspects of your basic mindfulness. I know sometimes a particular focus, whether for pain or music or something like that. Is there something that you could share with us in terms of how your techniques are being employed in maybe institutions or educationally or health facilities? I think the two things that come to mind immediately are that other teachers are using my materials to teach meditation, the YouTube materials. So they're capturing YouTube segments and using them in the curriculum. And I think that that's being done both for people teaching meditation pragmatically in the public, but also for people teaching courses on meditation in universities or courses that may be like Buddhism, Asian culture, comparative mysticism, that kind of thing, where academic professors are assigning some of my YouTube segments to supplement the supplementary materials. So that's one area. Then probably the most exciting thing is the development of music-based mindfulness for kids. And they're doing that in Portland State, and it was phenomenally successful. And we have Soryu's YouTube show, what we're doing in Burlington, Vermont. Now Soryu is in the public school system. First he was just in this after-school center with music-based mindfulness for kids. Now he's in the public schools doing mindfulness. And I think that's very exciting.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.3, "text": " I understand that you have some programs that are based on your techniques that have
