{"text": " My ears are asymmetrical, there's just no way around it. Get him to tell you that story. You know how my ears got asymmetrical? I'm not sure there's any deep dharma to it. I was in a car accident a long, long time ago. We flipped over in a little sports car. I was a passenger, we got sucked under a truck. It can actually happen, it's like a triumph. It's a very, very light car. We were going from San Francisco to LA. There's no dharma in this story, okay? Is there any dharma in this story? Can I make it into it? You can make it into it. No, there's no dharma. This was before I was into meditation. It was like way, way back in the crazy days. Me and my friend were driving back from San Francisco to LA. He just bought this car. I didn't want to use the safety belt. It may have been back when it still wasn't mandatory. He says, no, there's no way that we're going to drive without having that seat belt on. So I put it on. He was in a normal state of consciousness. I had decided to be in an altered state. Highly altered. It was back in the day. We were living in Haight-Ashbury, so you get the general idea here. What did you take? Huh? What did you take? Wow. Wow. I haven't heard this one. There's no dharma in this story. It's just like a weird story. I can't put a spin on it to be of any value to you. It's just, God, he did crazy shit. So, yeah, it's like a couple hours down from San Francisco. We just got sucked under a truck and then skidded out and fishtailed and then flipped over and over again and landed upside down. And of course, the only reason I'm still here is that I have the safety because otherwise I would have just been out. So, yeah, I'm just sort of tripping out. I see you're liking this story. It's not going anywhere. You can find a little dharma. Yeah, it's like things are getting, you know, the electrical poles were like becoming little sci-fi movies. And then there's sort of like this rumble. And then the next thing, it was just nothing. It was like I have complete retroactive amnesia. I was just, there was this rumble and the next thing I'm looking up at a highway patrolman. And he's like, you're right on. And my friend comes over and he's all bloody and everything. And he said, we had an accident. And I think I said, am I OK? And then I passed out. And then the next thing, I'm like in an ER. And this doctor is looking down at me and he says, your ear has been torn off, but don't worry, we can sew it back on. But mind you, the LSD trip is still happening. It did not stop. I don't want you to turn into a bad trip. It never did. It was never a bad trip. I said, oh, great, OK. But I wasn't a meditator. I just got lucky, I guess. I didn't freak out. And then apparently my friend, the guy that was driving, who eventually became an MD himself, actually, but he told me that we lucked out because the guy was a really good surgeon. And you can't tell that, you know, it's like you couldn't quite tell which one it was, but you could still see the scar here. So there were some funny parts, like my friend came up, he spoke Japanese. He was American. I mean, he was non-Asian, but we'd been in Japan together. So he says to me in Japanese, don't worry that the doctor's looking right in your eyes, because with head trauma your eyes dilate anyway. They're not going to know. So he's sneaking me this secret message in Japanese in front of the doctor. So I said, OK, good. And it was actually something pretty funny. So I had to be in the hospital, but then they let me out the next day. I really lucked out because it freaking totaled the car. I completely destroyed the car and neither of us sustained any significant injury. And my friend had the presence of mind to bury all the drugs by the roadside. Despite the fact that he thought he had killed me. I was just hanging there, unconscious, because the car was upside down. Not a serene scene, apparently. I have blessedly no memory of this at all. So they keep you in the hospital, and I'm just laying there at night, and I'm just peaking. I'm looking at the ceiling, and it's like flowers are blooming. Well, there's the Dharma, OK, expansion and contraction. It was very evident. I couldn't get to sleep, right? So I called the nurse, and I can't get to sleep. Just give me something to help me get to sleep. She says, oh, no, in cases of head trauma like this, we never want you to be on any drugs. I said, OK, OK, let's watch the movie for a few more hours. Actually, I fell asleep. That's how I got asymmetrical ears. But actually, I can work Dharma into this in a very minor way, which is after that, I started to have something. There was no untoward consequences of this, apparently, other than my parents pretty much freaked out when I called them. But it was OK. At the clinical EEG, they checked out everything. But I did start to have something happen that has subsequently happened from that time on, which is, and it was probably a consequence of this. I don't know, but there's something called sleep paralysis. You probably experienced it where you really think you're awake, and you can't move. And then all sorts of, sometimes some very weird stuff happens. Some people get Kundalini rising. They call it the exploding head syndrome. I've had that happen many times during the sleep paralysis. It's like someone sheared off a fire hydrant, if you've ever seen what that looks like, except it's going up your spine and blasting out of the top of your head. So I started to have occasionally those kinds of experiences. But the really weird things were I would have experiences where I thought I was awake and things had happened in the real world. I mean, I absolutely was convinced they had happened. But then when I checked reality with all people, they hadn't happened. So I was having dreams that were so vivid that they completely fooled me. And that was a little bit weird. And then, so some of you, if you've ever had this sleep paralysis, then you know what I'm talking about. Now, what's happened over the years is I eventually did start to meditate, but the sleep paralysis thing still happens. But it's completely different because now I'm lucid. I know it's happening and I know I'm a meditator. And so I can play with it. And I don't play with it. I just meditate in it and sort of explore it as an altered state. But in addition to the exploding head syndrome and the dreaming that is so vivid, that really sort of alters your sense of what might be reality. Like, let's just imagine if in 10 seconds you suddenly find yourself in bed and someone's waking you up saying you had a dream you were at a meditation retreat. Just imagine how jarring that would be. So that happened a lot of times. And that was sort of interesting because once again, I hadn't meditated yet, so I didn't have a context for this kind of thing. But it really does make you think, like, maybe this is just one really big dream. So anyway, that's... And the other cool thing is I completely understand alien abductions. I have been abducted by aliens. It's happened several times. And it's a classic. I mean, the whole classic thing, they're gibbering in some extraterrestrial language. And yes, it's true. It's true. I've experienced it myself several times. They do probes. Yes, I can confirm. And it is what they say. It's that place that gets probed. The one little difference is, you think I'm making this up? It's happened any number of times. But the one difference is I know it's happening in sleep paralysis. I don't think. But it's very, very vivid. It's actually the origin, this sleep paralysis and then weird shit happening with you being, like, violated, or in some way, like, being touched in a way you don't want to be touched, et cetera, et cetera. That is the origin of the word nightmare. Originally, well, night is night. What the hell is a mare? It's not a female equine species. A mare is a demon, and it may even be cognate to the Sanskrit word mara. I'm not quite sure about that, which is demons or devils in Buddhism. The original nightmare was an experience of an incubus or a succubus. These are, like, creatures that sit on your chest, or they prod you or bite you or do weird things that are, like, very uncomfortable. And this goes back centuries and centuries. You can look it up, succubus and incubus. Those were the Latin terms for it. But nightmare was the Anglo-Saxon. So this sort of being paralyzed in sleep and having weird stuff happening, that's \u2013 there's a lot of cultural references to it. But each age interprets it differently. So in the Middle Ages, where people were superstitious in the Christian sense, they thought it was devils and things like that. And nowadays people sort of have archetypes of sci-fi and space opera, so they experience it as an alien abduction. So I know that I'm just in sleep paralysis. I don't believe it's actually happening, but it's very, very vivid. It's as vivid as anything. But I don't know if this is true for other people, but I can tell you that when \u2013 as I'm waking up, as I'm waking up from this, I could actually watch the transition between the two realities, the one where there's these aliens and they're doing this anal probe thing, okay, and then coming back to the current physical reality. And I don't know if it's other people, it's the same or not, or this is just me. But as I'm coming back to ordinary reality, the experience of the anal probe becomes the experience of detecting my pulse in that region of my body. So apparently that's a slightly uncomfortable sensation if you're in a vulnerable sleep-like state and it gets interpreted. At least that's my experience. And it's always that. I can detect my pulse there. It has a physical basis. And I guess it's just a very sensitive region that when you're in a sleep state \u2013 Yeah, Louie's finding this hilarious. Has it happened to you? I refuse to talk about it. I know, it's very painful. It's hard to talk about. I can't reveal the source of my laughter. I can't reveal why I'm laughing. I see. Well, I tell you, I'm going to check to see if you've got a zipper back here. That you're just wearing a human suit of your love. Come to think of it, that seems plausible. I remember you from somewhere. Well, that is not a Dharma talk. But they say you should tell stories. That's how my ears got asymmetrical and how my mind got maybe commensurately warped.
