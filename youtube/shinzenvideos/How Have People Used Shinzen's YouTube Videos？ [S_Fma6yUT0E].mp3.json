{"text": " Okay, so I'm going to start off with asking you, since our first interview, which was January of 2009, and we are now in January of 2010, and since then you did all these interviews with Harprakash on YouTube, and you've had two whole YouTube channels now full of videos of Shenzhen out in the world. Has this changed anything? Has this affected you in any way, having all this YouTube presence now? It hasn't affected me personally that I'm aware of, but I think what it has done is made a lot of very useful material available to a lot of people, because we seem to be having people using this, and of course we have records of all the usage. I would say as far as me personally, the main impact has been I have a lot of very, very pleasant emotional body sensation at the knowledge that, because of the service that a couple of my students have done for me, yourself and Harprakash, now we've got thousands and thousands of people making use of this, and most of what I have to teach is just there in a very organized format, available 24-7, free to the world, Dharma on demand. Just gives me pleasant sensations. Have you heard of ways in which people may be using the videos that is helpful? I wouldn't have thought of. There are actually ways that I wouldn't have thought of. I thought people would mostly be using it for conceptual reference occasionally, but apparently people are using it on a consistent basis as a kind of teacher in your home for their day-to-day practice. Got a guru in your pocket, and you're just happy to see me. There we go.
