{"text": " So, I like to give people the option of practicing every kind of meditation technique that has ever been developed in the history of world mysticism. And I have this sort of grid where I classify all the techniques, like a periodic table of meditation strategies. So, I try to include in that everything that was a major invention or a major innovation. Some things in meditative technology have only been discovered once, many things have been discovered many times in different cultures. So, one thing that, as far as I know, was only strongly emphasized once is the notion of expressing spontaneity through how you move, how you speak, and the motor part of how you think. This is an aspect of liberation practice that was very much appreciated and developed within the Chan school of Chinese practice. It's particularly associated originally with a master named Mazu, and that eventually evolved into the Linji or Rinzai, as it's called in Japanese school of Zen. So, they put a big emphasis on manifesting impermanence, manifesting emptiness, manifesting non-self in how you move the body, how you sort of channel the words that are coming through your lips, and eventually also learning how to think without thinking. So, there's sort of like, if you do without thinking, there's a just happeningness and it's merged with the dynamic emptiness of nature, yang and yin. If you speak without thinking, same thing. A little trickier is to think without thinking, but it's the same general idea. It turns into thoughts that are spontaneous, creative, wise, and so forth. So, traditionally in Buddhism, they speak of the three karma-dvara, the three gates of action, kaya-vak-citta or kaya-vak-mana, means bodily motions, speech actions, and thought actions. So, I have in my repertoire of techniques a quadrant of training that I call spontaneity training. And I teach people how to access spontaneity in body movement, speech, thought, and even all three at the same time. So, my word, just to have a convenient word for this just happening, empty but rich dynamic quality in motion, to have a word for it, I call it auto from the original Greek meaning spontaneous. Corresponds to certain Asian concepts, the Chinese notion of ziran, which is shizen in Japanese. And there's many words in Tibetan that have this connotation of effortless just happening. Anyway, I call it auto to have a word for it. So, there's a technique of auto-walk or more broadly auto-move, auto-speak, and a specific example of that would be auto-chant, which is relatively easy to do. And then I even have an auto-think technique. So, the way you do auto-move is you just sort of tune into some motion that your body already knows how to do. And you just sort of follow the reflex. You taste the reflexness, the fact that the motor circuits know how to do it without there needing to be much of a thinking ego for it to happen. So, it's like being a little kid. When little kids walk, they just walk for the fun spontaneity or they run for the fun spontaneity or they, you know, like play around in puddles of water or whatever because it's just like, it just happens and they enjoy the just happeningness of it. So, to do the auto-walk, you tune into the fact that your body knows how to walk without needing a you. And it's a little intuitive. I can't really describe quite how to do it, but you just sort of get a feel for it with time. In the monastery, the way that people learn about this is by watching other people do it during the work periods or as you're walking from place to place. People do this sort of just walking thing, the more senior monks, and then you sort of pick up on it. So, I'm going to show you my particular way of doing the auto-walk. I'm pretty poorly coordinated so it's not going to be very elegant, but there will be a kind of spontaneity to it. So, you just sort of let your legs carry you. You know, I sort of defocus the gaze and it's just sort of happening and it's sort of fun. It's like you're being a little kid again. Now, I add a feature that is not required, which is I engage the visual field. It seems, in addition to this sort of, my legs know how to carry me without me. As I'm moving, it seems like the visual field is expanding in front, but the thing that I just saw an instant ago is collapsing behind me. So, it's like being a bolus being carried in this funnel of expanding light in front and contracting light behind. Then, I combine that with the sort of spontaneity of the movement of the legs and it's like space itself is just sort of carrying me as I'm walking along. I'm exaggerating now. I don't look this silly usually, but you get the general idea. It's just sort of expansion and contraction and the legs are just sort of moving on their own. You could just like play like this for a long time and it's rich because it's dynamic, it's bouncy, but it's empty because there's no one there. That was me making Shinzen do auto-walk for everyone on YouTube. Shin heads everywhere. And tomorrow, I'm going to get him to do auto-walk while auto-talking, auto-speaking, while auto-thinking.
