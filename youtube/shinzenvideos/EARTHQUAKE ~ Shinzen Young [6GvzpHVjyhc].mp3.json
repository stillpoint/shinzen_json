{"text": " Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could become a major turning point in the history of our species. We're having an earthquake. Is that what that is? Yeah. It's my first earthquake. I've been waiting 14 years. Well, I hope you weren't disappointed. That ain't much of an earthquake, baby. We have some entertainment up here in Palos Verdes just for y'all for tonight. Thank you. They seem to happen on Friday nights like this. Our second one in about two months on a Friday night, just about this time. Oh no, that's great. We were enjoying it. Chell is having a complete experience. What can I say? We could do a lot better than that. Yeah, we don't get them on the East Coast very much, it's true. The earthquake, yes. What to do when the earthquake comes. Well, there's a Zen koan. Anyone care to answer? What to do when the earthquake comes. That's the explanation. Or the manifestation. My explanation would be you can't shake the shaking. But permanence, complete experience, actually does feel like an earthquake. That earthquake was on cue for me. At least I'm going to interpret it that way. I was just about to say that when you have a completed experience, it feels like an earthquake. It shakes heaven and earth because it is the authentic person without a fixed position. I wasn't going to relate it to an earthquake. But it is a reasonable comparison and one, in fact, that I have made numerous times in the past. One of the times when I knew that this practice was really doing something industrial strength for me was when we had the center, some of you were around back that far, on Eldon Avenue, remember, in Koreatown. One morning I had to go in to do something that I'd forgotten. I had gotten in my car and then I said, oh, I forgot to do that. I ran into the center and I left the keys in the car. It's downtown, right? And sure enough, like two minutes later I came out, the car is gone. And what was that experience? I'm remembering it because at the time it was just like an earthquake. That's all. There was no thought, there was no emotion as an object. It was so complete that it was just space rocking. It was just like that last penultimate scene in the first Matrix when... What's the name of the character? Neo. Neo, yeah, Neo realizes who he is, right? And the whole frame of the movie sort of goes like that. I mean, that's really what it was like. It wasn't just my mind and my body, it was the sight and sound, everything. The whole frame of the self and scene was just this wave. And then it was just like being massaged. And then I just went in, called the cops, and that was that, you know, reported it. That was dramatic. That was a complete experience of having your car swiped in downtown L.A. The gangbangers that took it were so stupid, they put their graffiti in it. And the cops busted them. I eventually got the car back. Left the graffiti just for the cultural.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 23.86, "text": " Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could become a major turning", "tokens": [823, 300, 3263, 411, 264, 7203, 295, 264, 4120, 11, 3620, 300, 309, 727, 1813, 257, 2563, 6246], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.42276597023010254, "compression_ratio": 1.2450980392156863, "no_speech_prob": 0.10210169851779938}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 23.86, "end": 29.72, "text": " point in the history of our species.", "tokens": [935, 294, 264, 2503, 295, 527, 6172, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.42276597023010254, "compression_ratio": 1.2450980392156863, "no_speech_prob": 0.10210169851779938}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2972, "start": 29.72, "end": 31.2, "text": " We're having an earthquake.", "tokens": [492, 434, 1419, 364, 308, 18352, 358, 619, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2972, "start": 31.2, "end": 34.24, "text": " Is that what that is?", "tokens": [1119, 300, 437, 300, 307, 30], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 4, "seek": 2972, "start": 34.24, "end": 35.24, "text": " Yeah.", "tokens": [865, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 5, "seek": 2972, "start": 35.24, "end": 38.239999999999995, "text": " It's my first earthquake.", "tokens": [467, 311, 452, 700, 18778, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 6, "seek": 2972, "start": 38.239999999999995, "end": 44.239999999999995, "text": " I've been waiting 14 years.", "tokens": [286, 600, 668, 3806, 3499, 924, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 7, "seek": 2972, "start": 44.239999999999995, "end": 51.239999999999995, "text": " Well, I hope you weren't disappointed.", "tokens": [1042, 11, 286, 1454, 291, 4999, 380, 13856, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 8, "seek": 2972, "start": 51.239999999999995, "end": 59.239999999999995, "text": " That ain't much of an earthquake, baby.", "tokens": [663, 7862, 380, 709, 295, 364, 18778, 11, 3186, 13], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5768575815054087, "compression_ratio": 1.3823529411764706, "no_speech_prob": 0.000597272184677422}, {"id": 9, "seek": 5924, "start": 59.24, "end": 62.84, "text": " We have some entertainment up here in Palos Verdes just for y'all for tonight.", "tokens": [492, 362, 512, 12393, 493, 510, 294, 6116, 329, 4281, 14792, 445, 337, 288, 6, 336, 337, 4440, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5195715571024332, "compression_ratio": 1.4773869346733668, "no_speech_prob": 0.05026610568165779}, {"id": 10, "seek": 5924, "start": 62.84, "end": 64.84, "text": " Thank you.", "tokens": [1044, 291, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5195715571024332, "compression_ratio": 1.4773869346733668, "no_speech_prob": 0.05026610568165779}, {"id": 11, "seek": 5924, "start": 64.84, "end": 66.84, "text": " They seem to happen on Friday nights like this.", "tokens": [814, 1643, 281, 1051, 322, 6984, 13249, 411, 341, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5195715571024332, "compression_ratio": 1.4773869346733668, "no_speech_prob": 0.05026610568165779}, {"id": 12, "seek": 5924, "start": 66.84, "end": 72.84, "text": " Our second one in about two months on a Friday night, just about this time.", "tokens": [2621, 1150, 472, 294, 466, 732, 2493, 322, 257, 6984, 1818, 11, 445, 466, 341, 565, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5195715571024332, "compression_ratio": 1.4773869346733668, "no_speech_prob": 0.05026610568165779}, {"id": 13, "seek": 5924, "start": 72.84, "end": 76.84, "text": " Oh no, that's great.
