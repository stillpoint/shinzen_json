{"text": " Let's say that there is a necessary cause behind the necessary cause. And the necessary cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neurophysiological in nature. Then there could be interventions that directly address that neurophysiological. So you knock out the physiological necessary condition for tanha, therefore you knock out tanha, therefore you knock out what blocks perfection. So, potentially, any piece of research into craving, if it were done very deeply, might unlock a key physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can't get much funding for research on enlightenment, but you can get funding for research on drug addiction. Isn't that funny? But if research on drug addiction were to be done in a way that would be able to go very, very deep and very, very broad, it's possible that the necessary cause for tanha could be found and eliminated. Which would mean, if we take the Buddhist model, that there would be a physiological, and don't ask me what kind, because I don't know. If I did know, I'd get the Nobel Prize. I have no idea. Is it some super kind of biofeedback? Is it fMRI biofeedback? Is it TMS stimulation? Is it what they call DREADS, which sounds bad, but they're like these... Sounds like a hair stand. No, it's designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows what, but if there were a way to knock out the necessary cause for the necessary cause, and it was purely physiological, then nirvana would actually simply happen. Now, what I find the delicious notion is that you can get funding for craving research, and you could get funding for deep and broad craving research, and you could get funding from Republicans, gladly, for deep and broad craving research.
