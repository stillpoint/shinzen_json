{"text": " Yeah, you know, the woo-woo words, they can help and they can really get in the way. And sometimes I get a little cynical and think the woo-woo words are used to join students who will keep paying their dues. Well, I suspect that there are, there's a range of motivations among teachers. I'll give you some inside information on teachers, okay. Teachers have a range of motivations. And yeah, sometimes it's to, you know, make sure the Donna stream is maintained. And, but I used to be extremely cynical and rude about all of this stuff when I started. Because I basically, you know, I just thought it was BS, you know, early, very early on when I was a kid and I was just studying this stuff. It was cool to read about and I liked it and I liked the Asian languages. But I really thought that it was all made up by the monks in order to deceive the faithful. I mean, I really thought that. And when I went to Asia and I heard great masters speak, I mean, I was privileged. I actually like heard people like Yamada Munon, Shibayama Zenkei, maybe these names don't mean much to you. But these are the gods of mid-20th century Japanese Zen. And they were still alive when I was there, both of them. And I could speak and understand Japanese. I actually heard these people give talks. And I didn't think they were making it up in order to increase the temple revenue. But what I did think is they were making it up to blow people's minds. To like say really weird stuff. It's like, you know, it sort of grabs you. So I thought it was like a Zen affectation, like an affected style of presenting things. It's just basically it's like, you know, blow people's minds and get people's attention, whatever. Now I hear myself saying this. I mean, I realize, oh my god, I mean now I know for sure what the motivation in those cases was. I can't say about the kids, the high school kids, you know, at the gate of the temple that are trying to get your shekels, okay.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 18.0, "text":
