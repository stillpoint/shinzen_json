{"text": " I was wondering where cultivating positive or identifying positive exists within both gone. Well, the question is, where is positive within both gone? It's not. That's sort of the whole point. No positive, no negative. This is as close as you get to the non-human as you can get. However, the great parents, so intrinsically, there is no love, there is no hate there, intrinsically. But still, that's hitting a human being. We're still a human being. And when we get hit by the impersonal, that tends to trigger a sense of deep human love. But it's not intrinsic to the impersonal. It's intrinsic to the fact that you're still a human being. And touching that, which is, as is said, strikes down God and the devil simultaneously. So you would think, well, that's a little bit more like the devil than God. Because it's like, where's ethics, where's love? But that's the central mystery. When the human touches the non-human, the human is nurtured and improved by way of reaction. So touching the non-human source is, when you come back, the ripples of love are there? That's pretty much it. So then the authentic person is in the source, but not in the ripples of love? Well, the authentic person is the puppeteer. And the puppet that that invisible hand is inserted into very much will be manifesting love and compassion in the world. So it's the power source. You can think of it on an analogy of broadcasting. So there's the wattage of the station. That's power, that's joules per second. That's the rate at which energy is going out. However, the wattage is not the only parameter of a radio or TV station. There's a modulation that goes on, on that wattage that carries a message. It could be music, it could be, okay, and it can modulate either amplitude or frequency. But the point is, there's a message that's riding on that energy wave. It's modulated or encoded. But it's not the energy wave itself. The energy wave is just pure energy. So that's inside the puppet, is that energy wave. But the surface of the puppet should be unapproachable, abstract, admirable, helpful human being. That's what I call classical enlightenment, or class C enlightenment, as opposed to crazy wisdom or other things that people do, where the surface is not necessarily unapproachable, admirable, helpful, and ordinary human being. So that's how I look at it. So if somebody is in touch with the source and also in touch with being beneficial to other human beings, they're going source here, source here, source here, source here, something like that? Well, you can use different metaphors. You could use an alternating metaphor, but I sort of like the spatial metaphor of there's space inside you that's sort of animating you, anima. There's different possible metaphors.
