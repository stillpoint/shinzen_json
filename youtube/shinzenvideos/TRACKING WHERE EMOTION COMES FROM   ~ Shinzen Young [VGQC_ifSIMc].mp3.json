So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well the two flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other. Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking. And you might want to look in that direction. And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special exercise that, with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but I'll ask you. Have we ever done noting feel sources? What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. No, we haven't done that. Noted fear, I call that noting feel sources. And feel can be generic or specific. That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this. Because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other senses that are activating the fear in real time. And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? It's a bunch of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically what's triggering what. And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear in the body. Now you know that the subconscious mind... I'm quite aware of having that. Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to note, did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly reduces the overwhelm.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.0, "text": " Remind me that I had some other ideas
