{"text": " Able to get a little sense of that? Oh yeah. So that's a catharsis, a releasing of fear. It creates this kind of center of this, it's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the center but then I get really hot. Yeah, let the joy be there, let the heat be there. These are all reactions to the catharsis. And if the heat produces more fear, then just dissipate that in the fear. Accept that we're going to let go of the fear now and go to the sadness. And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do. Same procedure, start with the periphery of the sadness flavor, work with that, see if it's amenable through a zoom out process to an experience of a global flow in the sadness. If that's feasible, do that and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if indeed that's sort of doable at this time. I'd like you to explore the doability of that with regards to sadness. Just give it some time. Ever able to get a little hint of that? Yeah, since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread, I just kind of instead of, since I didn't quite have the subtle area, I just went around the boundaries of it. That's exactly correct. That corresponds to the subtle, it's just less widespread. That was a good move. I just made the boundaries soft and then treated that like... That's right, that's what I would have had you do. So you're able to get a little sense of that. Yeah. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to have you do a fairly intricate concentration where you're going to attempt to experience simultaneously a kind of river of fear and a kind of river of sad that flow through each other, interpenetrating without interfering. So it's almost like... Could you say that again? Oh yeah, right. There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like giant liquid drop that's sort of expanding and contracting, right? Right. And there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same essential dance. Right. Now, you know how in a ghost movie you see that the ghost can walk through the wall, right? Right. The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. Now imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing each other when they occupied the same place at the same time. So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavored sad, and they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all of them can occupy the same place. So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. Does this metaphor make sense? Yeah. Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? Not in this, not this round. This may be the part of the missing piece, because you could get them individually to flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow. Because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering, then they won't multiply together into overwhelm. So the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. It's an interesting intimacy between them. It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. Okay, good. How's that coming? Good. Good. Good in what sense? When I can allow them both to share the same space and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping that line between them, and when I allow them to just kind of do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, a very intense version of that, and then it kind of seems to ignite this PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. Yes, I am. This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive, but your facial expression proves it.
