{"text": " Someone asked me an interesting question in one of the onlines about no self and it sort of got me talking and thinking about the topic. There is a sometimes say that the Buddhists are their own worst PR people. I mean that the words that are used to try to sell Buddhism suffering, impermanence, emptiness, no self or even more inscrutable and off-putting no soul which is sometimes the translation. Of course there are very very good reasons why this terminology is used. But at first it's confusing and off-putting, I mean emptiness. There's that Jewish Buddhist humor thing, I don't know if you've seen on the internet all these Jewish Buddhist jokes. There's one, I can't remember exactly, I'm paraphrasing, but what's Zen? Well you bust your tush for 40 years and what do you have to show for it at the end? Babkas. Babkas means, I mean it means beans literally, but it means like nothing, right? You've got nothing to show for it. Well yeah but it's a very special nothing. I mean when I started I had no idea what these terms referred to. They sounded weird, they sounded interesting. I learned how to say them in a half dozen Asian languages, but it's like I didn't know what they were talking about. Emptiness, well actually sometimes people would say like the void, so of course I had this image of this like gaping thing that's going to suck you in. Actually there's a little validity to that in the sense of the expansiveness of the formless jhanas. That's part of it, but not at all the whole picture. So you know I would hear about the void or the emptiness and I'd try to formulate in my mind what it must be. And of course it's not just the Buddhists that talk about things like that. Essentially all the mystics all around the world have used very similar languaging and the language is counterintuitive, it's strange sounding, and yet it lines up across cultures which tends to indicate that there's something universal going on here. Why would the cultures that had no contact, I mean obviously sometimes the cultures have contact, there's cultural diffusion, but I mean why should something written in the 6th century in Sri Lanka line up so well with something written in the 16th century in Spain and those worlds had no contact at all. But you read Teresa Avila's Interior Castle and you read the Visuddhimagga and it's not perfect but there's a lot of alignment there, surprising alignment. Teresa ends up saying in the end it took her a lifetime, she went through the jhanas, the Christian version of that, and only at the very end of her career did she come to this transformation in her understanding. You can see that she struggles to convey the difference. She's described all of these ever deeper states of recollection, tranquility, and so forth, and then you can see her struggling to try to describe something that belonged to a whole other dimension. She said it was an intellectual vision, but then she said, but I don't mean that I saw a vision of Jesus or something, something changed in my mind and my concept about things and what changed was, to use her words, the self-forgetting is so profound that it seems as though the soul no longer exists. Well that's streametric. The salient defining feature is insight into the non-somethingness of self, the sakhaya identity, the view that there is a sakhaya, a thing, an entity called self within. Now you might think that writing in the age of the Inquisition in Spain that someone would get in trouble for saying something like that, but she didn't get into trouble at all. In fact she became the main mapmaker for Christian mystics, it's like, okay, because she gave such clear descriptions. So it's sort of interesting that these descriptions somewhat line up and they're counterintuitive. So emptiness and nothingness is like across all the traditions. So I, you know, in my mind I tried to imagine, and I mentioned that there was a period in my, when I and the rest of the United States was doing a lot of LSD, some of you remember that time, that's why you're here now. Anyway, so I had these ideas about what the void was supposed to be then, and I have ideas now, except the ideas now are not based on speculation, they're based on direct experience. So if I were to say what the emptiness means to me, what comes to my mind first, it's two things. A kind of bounciness, like a basketball that like bounces. And the second thing would be a connectivity, a connector that holds the whole universe together and therefore is naturally linked to a sense of love. So that's really counterintuitive, you wouldn't think emptiness would have either this springiness or a sense of connectivity or love, it just doesn't quite compute. But that's, those are the first things that come to my mind. So, and yet we also, I can also understand why they call it vacuity or emptiness or nothingness, etc., etc. So yeah, it's counterintuitive. I could also tell you that like an apple, the first thing that hits your teeth when you bite into an apple is not necessarily representative of the whole apple. Unless you peel it, you get the skin which is sort of hard and dry. But most of the apple is going to be juicy and sweet. And the first bite that people take into emptiness, which is a phase that might last a few hours or a few years, when your teeth are just getting beyond the skin, that's not, that experience might be sort of bleak and flat and vacuous. But that's just getting past the skin. Once you're past that, it's this other thing, it's this springy connectivity that provides safety, fulfillment and a sense of love. So anyway, the, in the online someone asked me the different flavors of no-self. And every time I think about that, I come up with a different list over the years. So like a list came up to me and I thought it was interesting, so I thought I would share it with you. But who knows what it will be next month or next year. That's the thing, it's, you know the story of the elephant and the blind man, but you may not know that that comes from Buddhism. It's a metaphor. The elephant is enlightenment. People have, tend to see a certain part of it and so describe it. Well, it's like a rope or it's like a wall or it's like a pillar or it's like a sharp, like a tusk. Or it's like a hose. Well, yeah, all of that, all of that, because there's all these different facets to it, which is, can be confusing. So it's important not to fixate one's view. One of my teachers used to say, Kyo no satori wa ashita no machigai. Today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake. Meaning not error, but rather that your perspective broadens and deepens and changes as time goes on. So when people do come to an experience, either slowly and smoothly or suddenly, of emptiness, no self, what have you, one of the first pieces of advice I give them is don't fixate however compelling today's view of it may be for you. Don't fixate that it's got to be that way. And for God's sake, don't stop studying with competent teachers. Because sometimes people go off, they think they're done when they're just beginning, actually. So we have this meeting that takes place every few years, where the so-called Western teachers, which means people teaching Buddhism full-time in the West, it doesn't have anything to do with your race, it's just where your main activity is, is it in the Americas and Europe and so forth, as opposed to the homeland of Buddhism, Asia. So there's this Western teachers meeting and it's like a professional meeting for people that do this full-time. So it's interesting and for me, I've always enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun. And it's like a professional meeting and people discuss topics and so forth. So this was a number of years ago, we broke up into interest groups. So you got to choose what interest group you're going to be. So I chose the group that was called, quote, how do you deal with the issue of enlightenment? So I thought that sounds interesting. I'll go to that group because I definitely have some ideas. But it was like sort of sad because it turns out it wasn't what I thought it was. The topic was not what I thought. I thought it's like, okay, a bunch of teachers are going to get together and tell their strategies and their algorithms for leading people to stream entering. But that's not what it was about. It was about how do you avoid marginalizing students who aren't yet enlightened and still talk about enlightenment. It was like the avatar of everything that's wrong with politically correct. Sorry if that offended someone. But it's like, well, we don't want to make people feel bad because they're not enlightened yet or whatever. So it's like, oh, well, that's not what I thought that was going to be. So let me say what I couldn't say in that meeting. Well, in general, any approach has the potential of showing you the no self, any approach. So it's not like one is privileged over another. And in fact, it's not infrequent that no approach shows someone no self. So people that don't meditate, that don't have a practice, it just happens. Not uncommon. So in theory, any of the techniques can do the trick or some combination thereof. But if someone were to come to me and actually specifically say, I want stream entry, what I would probably start them off on is the focus in technique. That entails working with mental images, mental talk, and body motion. I'm saying that's what I would probably start off with, not like, oh yes, this is the silver bullet, the white knight, the magic thing that guarantees stream entry. But for me, in my algorithm, it's a good place to start because it's pretty straightforward. A beginner can do it. And it's likely to bring some sort of insight fairly quickly. So the idea is that you go to image space and there's either images or there isn't. So you note, see or rest. Then you go to talk space, same thing. Emotional body, same thing. Then you work with the whole system. So when you're working with the whole system, different things can happen. One of the things that can happen is that the system goes offline, typically momentarily. Mental screen is blank, head is quiet, body is emotionally neutral. Now, typically the reason that happens is that something in the outer system sort of expands in intensity. A physical sensation or a sound. There's a lot of famous Zen stories along these lines. Someone's enlightened by hearing a pebble strike the broom or the teacher shouts. Or one of my favorites, when you take a bath in the Zen temple in Japan, you bathe in something that looks like this except it's like huge and it's a pot actually that's heated from the bottom. You take off all your clothes and there's this statue of Baradwaja, who's the patron of the bathing area. You have to bow down like this or whatever because he was an arhat and the way he got enlightenment was taking a bath. Okay. It's like, okay, a bath can do it. So typically external sight, external sound and body and or physical body sensation sort of impinges suddenly. And if you're monitoring the inner system, instead of getting pulled into that, you notice that as that expands, the inner system goes into a state of relative rest. Now that can happen to people in an early part of their practice. That's already, that's not like enlightenment or anything, but they're already getting a sort of insight as to how this system works. Now there's another version of that that's more dramatic. And if that happens and you have a clear experience, that might change things on a more permanent basis. Instead of the inner system going into a relative state of rest, meaning see rest, hear rest, feel rest, you're aware your screen is blank, you're listening to quiet in your head, your body's emotionally neutral. Instead of that, you're aware that the inner space itself just vanishes. There is no image space, there is no talk space, there is no emotional body space. That's absolute rest in the inner system. It's like the relative rest that a beginner can have only more so. So one flavor of no self even a beginner can experience. It's like for a moment there's relative rest, maybe because there's a strong activation on the outside. The inner system gets relatively restful. Then there's a much more impactful restful state that's an absolute rest, a cessation of the space of self itself. So there's two flavors of no self right there. What else? Well does that mean that in order to experience no self the inner system has to turn off? Well not necessarily. The inner system can be quite active, but it's not tangled and not coagulated. If the inner system activates even strongly, but all the strands are clearly separate, they're not crisscrossing in an unconscious way, and if there's little or no freezing or coagulation in that system, it'll be active, but it's a kind of flow self. And that is yet another flavor of no self. It's tricky though to truly untangle that inner system because the tangling is at many scales simultaneously. My metaphor would be if, let's say you have three kinds of strands, red, green and blue. The problem is they exist at many, many diameters. There's like, you know, there's three inch thick and one inch thick and a tenth of an inch thick and, you know, a half a centimeter and a millimeter and even sub-millimeter. There's all, for each one of the three colors there's all these different scales and now they're all intertwined. So inside red is subtle blue and inside that is subtler green, etc., etc., and then maybe even subtler red again. So to fully untangle that scale takes a little bit of practice. But if you can sufficiently untangle it and if you can let go of the tendency to tighten around its arising and passing, oh my God, did it take me years to not resist the arising of self. Because I thought, well, the goal of this practice is quote no self, so if I'm aware of a self I'm a failure with the practice and that creates all sorts of tension. It took a long time to get out of that bad rookie habit. So anyway, the inner system activates perhaps even strongly, perhaps even in a very negative way, but it's untangled and unblocked. That will create another flavor of self, of no self rather. It's a freedom because of intensity of clarity. It's an untangling effect. It's an anti-emergent quality. Turns out that one of the requisites for the somethingness of self is that there be a kind of tangling of things. So the satkhyaditti depends on lack of clarity. In fact, you probably know that there's a traditional metaphor that's very famous in the Buddhist world. A monk named Nagasena learned it from a nun named Vajira and he passed it on to King Melinda, also known as King Menandros. So Melinda is what he was known as in Pali, but his Greek name was Menandros. He was a Greek king about 2,000 years ago in the western part of India, part of the remnant from Alexander's invasions of India. So he's a westerner and he had this dialogue with the Buddhist monk Nagasena and it's recorded in Pali literature. It's fascinating. We know that this Menandros was a real person because he's recorded in Greek history also. In the western accounts, it is said that he died very peacefully. So maybe it's true that he did actually become a Buddhist meditator. In any event, the conversation has been preserved. It's called Melinda Panha, the questions of King Melinda or Menandros. So Nagasena gives the metaphor of a chariot and he goes through all the different parts of the chariot and says, is the chariot the wheels? Is the chariot the body? Is the chariot the axle tree? Is the chariot this, that? And the king has to admit, no, none of those parts are it. And then he says, well, it's the same for self. And then he goes through the five aggregates or something like that. I can't remember exactly. He sort of breaks selfhood into its components and tries to show the king that there is no thing inside called a self. So that's a famous metaphor. I have my own version, which I think is more to the point, neuroanatomically. And most of you have heard this, but I'll just go over it quickly. So you have an old-fashioned CRT TV screen and monitor and there's white on the screen. It's a color monitor, but it shows white on the screen. And I say to you, there is no quality of white on this screen. And you say, are you nuts? Just look at it. It's white. And I say, well, here's a magnifying glass. And we agree that this does nothing but make things a little bigger and resolve. Resolve means things that fall together to the naked eye are separated by the lens. You can look this up if you want to know what the resolution power is. Resolution power doesn't change what's out there. It just means that things that are tangled get untangled. And I say, okay, so now we're going to approach this white screen with this magnifying glass, which we agree does nothing but make things look larger and resolve. In other words, untangle the sensory components. And what's going to happen as we approach? The impression white will go away and the impression red, green, blue little pixels will arise. And that's what was always there. So an emergent quality. This is a metaphor, just like Naga Singh and Sister Vajira's metaphor. This is a metaphor that probably is a little closer to the actual underlying neuroscience of the thing, although it's probably not identical, but I think it's closer than the traditional one. There's an emergent property in perception that requires a tangling of the sensory components. And as they get untangled, that emergent quality disappears. In the case of the white on the screen, the emergent quality is the impression of whiteness. In the case of self, the emergent quality is the impression it's a thing. So as you look more and more carefully, I like to do it inner-seer field, but we could do the five skandhas, we could do the four elements, we could do the four foundations of mindfulness. There's a lot of ways that you can parse that pie. The important thing is not so much what categories you use, but the magic of the dimensional analysis. I like the inner-seer field because it satisfies Occam's razor. It's the simplest one that I know of. You can look up the five aggregates or five skandhas on Wikipedia and see if you can imagine meditating based on the definitions you see there, because it's pretty inscrutable. But anyway, so that's why I like to use this other thing. It's simpler and it's immediately observable. You have to be a very, very advanced meditator to be able to observe the samskaras, for example. No beginner can observe that, but any beginner can observe inner-seer field. So that's another flavor of no-self. That's the no-self that just comes from untangling the system. Are there other flavors of no-self? Yeah. If there's enough unblocking, if there's enough decoagulation, the inner system arises as sort of like a lot of vibrating bubbles. It's like effervescent bubbles. It's all flow. If you get that where the inner system is mostly like just shimmering on your screen and stirring in talk space and a kind of undercurrent of activity in the emotional body that may not have any particular flavor to it, but it's like the emotional circuits are sort of idling down there. If you get this fluid experience of the inner system, that's a whole other flavor of no-self. What I like to do when that happens is cover inner space because you may not be able to parse the seer field very clearly when it goes into that subtle level of vibratory flow, but what you can do is cover the whole space and then just let your awareness soak into it. The more you soak into it, the more vibrant the space becomes. Okay, well that's a whole other flavor of no-self which is sort of like the flow-self. Some of these flavors of no-self are available to beginning meditators. Some of them not so much. The disappearance of inner space, that's a little bit on the advanced side. There's also an advanced version of the flow-self. If the system becomes pliant enough, each time there's an inner activation, that means each time there's a reaction to the outer world, each time there's memory plant fantasy, each time there's a judgment or a conviction or a confusion that arises in the inner system, each time there's an awareness that was fermented into existence by simultaneous expansion and contraction. Now, when that starts to happen, the ordinary self, all these ordinary things, including your confusions and your desires and your judgments, they're never disconnected from the Source because they arise in the folds of expansion and contraction. Sort of the two sides of God, if you want to sort of get the G word. Some people don't like that word, but I like it. If you don't, then use something else. Expansion and contraction. So expansion and contraction, they touch each ordinary part of you. On the other hand, they touch that collapse of space thing also, because that's where they come from. Plus and minus pull apart, expansion and contraction polarize. And then they neutralize. When they neutralize, the space of experience goes away. And when that happens with the inner space, that's absolute rest. And then that absolute rest breaks apart into the absolute flow of simultaneous expansion and contraction. So it's an extraordinary thing when your ordinary experience of self is embraced on the inside and outside by the spiritual Source. And then there's no reason why that doesn't also extend out to the outer sphere field. So actually, when someone gets enlightened, the world gets enlightened. There's a famous Zen story to that effect. This person struggled for years and years and years as a monk to get enlightenment. It didn't work out. And he was living on this mountain called Dozan. And finally he gave up and went to the master. And the master told him something. I don't remember the exact story. But he said, okay, if you have to leave the temple, you know, you have to leave. But something, sorry, I forgot what the something was. But as he's going down the mountain, whatever that something was, it had planted the seed. And he suddenly had this realization after all these years of struggling and confusion. And he blurted out the words that just came out of his mouth were, the mountain has become enlightened, not I became enlightened. So what does that mean? It just means that the external see, hear, feel is born in the folds of the same polarization of the Source. That's all. So traditionally when it happens to the inner system, we call it Muga in Japanese, means no self. When it happens to everything, inner and outer, it's called ku or emptiness. But the really just the same thing. So these are a few ways to think tangibly about no self. And at least a couple of those would be something you can understand and even a beginner can pursue with practice.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 20.52, "text": " Someone asked me an interesting question in one of the onlines about no self and it sort", "tokens": [8734, 2351, 385, 364, 1880, 1168, 294, 472, 295, 264, 322, 11045, 466, 572, 2698, 293, 309, 1333], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5252399878068403, "compression_ratio": 1.1891891891891893, "no_speech_prob": 0.03466459736227989}, {"id": 1, "seek": 2052, "start": 20.52, "end": 33.68, "text": " of got me talking and thinking about the topic.
