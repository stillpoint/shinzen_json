{"text": " Sometimes people say, hey, Shifton, you've got a label for the moment of vanishing, gone. What's wrong? Why don't you have a label for the moment of arising? I do. I absolutely have a label for the moment of arising that we use in when we do the expanse in contraction flow. The moment of arising at a very deep, deep level of understanding. The moment of arising is the moment when the space of that experience simultaneously comes into existence and begins going out of existence. My label for that is both. Both expansion and contraction. They've pulled apart and they are molding the present moment. Both gone. Both gone. Both gone. Both gone. You sum up all those boths and gons and you have a giant eternal fountain of youth that is always simultaneously spreading and collapsing and pervaded with the absolute tranquility of a trillion vanishings. To the extent that you have become that, that there's been a figure of ground reversing. That instead of thinking about that or observing that, you actually participate in that. Well, that's an eternal fountain of youth. So to that extent, you become that. Your personal death is much less of an issue. Because by personal death you mean the death of a mind and body. But to the extent that you've re-identified with the flow of the source, that's not going to go away. So quote you will never go away. To that extent. And to the extent that there's been a figure of ground reversal and instead of observing it, it's been gone, there's just gone and things come and go from it. Well to that extent you won't actually notice the difference between being alive and being dead. And as strange as that sounds, that means that you won't have to die.
