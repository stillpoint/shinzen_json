{"text": " The ancient Taoists had experienced the same thing and had an interesting phraseology for it. It relates to jing qi shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you've studied Asian medicine or martial arts and so forth. So jing means essence, literally. So essence of what? Well, in terms of sensory experience, often in the process of completing an experience, a certain flavor has to sort of get distilled and dominate your awareness. And that distillation of that experience could be described in Chinese as jing, or essence. Now in the Taoist practice, this particular distillation that they often worked with was sexual sensation. But this can be generalized to any kind of experience, and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the body, although it's sort of easiest to understand there, but the same thing can happen in visual and in auditory. You sort of... everything gets distilled. So let's say, for example, you are working on having fear no longer be an issue for you. How can that be? Because there's so many circumstances of fear in this world, so many legitimate reasons to be afraid. It just goes on and on and on. How can it be that a human being could become a human being for whom fear is no longer an issue? Broader still. If you can do that, well, why not add in grief and sadness? Or anger? Or on a more mundane note, that frenetic impatience that we have all day, that comes out when you're in a traffic jam? Which is very ordinary, but actually a source of significant suffering in the world. And now at the other extreme, what you would hardly think any human being could ever come to grips with, shame and embarrassment. How about that one? So anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, impatience, disgust. Those are the big six on the negative side of flavors of human emotion. I know for sure that a human being can reach the point where those are no longer an issue for them. So how is that possible? How is it possible to do with all of those? How is it possible to do with even one of those? Well, first you have to be willing to allow it to distill into an essence. What that means is that particular favor, whichever one it is, anger, fear, sadness, each one has its own very distinct quality in the body. So the essence of fear occurs when there is nothing but the fear sensation. It is in every cubic centimeter of your body, and it is continuous, unbroken in time, for a period of time. Now, we're very, very afraid of what the consequences of that would be. But the fear of the consequences of that is actually what keeps us imprisoned for our whole life. Because the consequences of allowing it to become essence, in the way I've just described, the consequences are nothing negative at all. The long-term consequences are freedom. But because we're afraid to let it go to that point, very few people become free. So if the shit really hits the fan to the point where you cannot avoid one or a combination of these negative emotions becoming essence, well, in a sense that could be a very good thing. So I repeat, there is nothing but that flavor, essentially hardly aware of anything else in the body. It's everywhere, and it's continuous through time. So now you are inundated with the essence of shame, or grief, or fear. Or the impatience associated with being in a traffic jam and you're late to an appointment. That one is just about as hard to work with as all the others. It took me, oh my God, from the time I realized what the task was, which is what I'm now describing to you, from the time I realized what the task was, to the time where I could actually do it with that impatience thing in traffic and not suffer. Well, I don't want to... Maybe I shouldn't say this. Twenty years. But the twenty years passed anyway. I know what you're saying, well, I don't have twenty years. But that's another Dharma talk. I'm going to give a talk about aging. But the quick answer is, aging is a natural state of no-self. So you've got something going for you. But if you're young and have twenty years, well, it might not take you twenty years, but it took me twenty years to get to the point where it really felt good, like liberating, to have that level of essence with impatience. Like I say, if you're already old, you've already got some things going for you, we'll talk about that later. So there's hope in both cases. So it becomes essence. And then it starts to get sort of liquidy. \u5316\u7cbe\u4e3a\u6c14 The essence converts into a kind of energy that is first sort of liquidy and then sort of shimmering and gaseous. And then \u5316\u6c14\u4e3a\u5584 That becomes this effortless, simultaneous, formless, rich doing of space, spaciousness, effortlessly spreading, effortlessly collapsing. And it's at that point that you have a complete experience of that particular essence. It has now become \u5584, pure spirit. Now, as I say, they did this traditionally with sexual sensations. So it's the same process. The sexual sensation inundates the entire body, there's nothing but that. And it's very hard to have equanimity with that. It's hard to have equanimity with uncomfortable things, but it's also hard to have equanimity with intense pleasures. And then it starts to flow everywhere. And then it's sort of like more gaseous. And then it's just pure space. And that's what the Tibetans called \u5fb7\u540c\u610f\u800c\u7f8e The non-duality of bliss and void. So if you can go through that phase progression with just a half dozen negatives, it's a small list. Unfortunately, each one of those essences, each one of those flavors, has been honed by Darwin to control animals. And by Darwin I don't mean the man Darwin, I mean natural selection over millions and millions of years. So it is very hard to allocate all your resources to having a complete experience of these things, because everything in the sensation says, I got to do something about this, I got to do something about this, I got to do something about this, because those sensations have been honed by evolution to make animals do something quickly about something. Either approach it and eat it, or run away from it, etc. etc. Or make love to it, etc. etc. etc. So it's very hard to just allocate the totality of your resources towards completing. But all you have to do is do that a few times, or well, more than a few times, a few hundred times. And then it becomes habitual. Then for the rest of your life, you will have experiences in your emotional world that are maximally poignant and minimally problematic.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 15.0, "text": " The ancient Taoists had experienced the same thing and had an interesting phraseology for it.", "tokens": [440, 7832, 26580, 1751, 632, 6751, 264, 912, 551, 293, 632, 364, 1880, 9535, 1793, 337, 309, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.38158911101672116, "compression_ratio": 1.3513513513513513, "no_speech_prob": 0.08354738354682922}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 15.0, "end": 29.0, "text": " It relates to jing qi shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you've studied Asian medicine", "tokens": [467, 16155, 281, 361, 278, 9505, 72, 402, 282, 11, 597, 366, 2115, 300, 291, 815, 312, 4963, 365, 498, 291, 600, 9454, 10645, 7195], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.38158911101672116, "compression_ratio": 1.3513513513513513, "no_speech_prob": 0.08354738354682922}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2900, "start": 29.0, "end": 31.0, "text": " or martial arts and so forth.", "tokens": [420, 20755, 8609, 293, 370, 5220, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2577279620700412, "compression_ratio": 1.3902439024390243, "no_speech_prob": 0.00868450477719307}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2900, "start": 31.0, "end": 36.0, "text": " So jing means essence, literally.
