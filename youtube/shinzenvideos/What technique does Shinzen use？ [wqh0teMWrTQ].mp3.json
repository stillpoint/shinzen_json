{"text": " Out of curiosity, what strategy do you generally employ using your technique? You mean as I'm laughing around in the world? No, not on the cushion. Oh, on the cushion? Yeah. Mostly both God. Simultaneous expansion, contraction, and their vanishing. So flow and... Well, both. Both is the label for an awareness that there is simultaneous expansion and contraction. That's part of the... So the quick answer is in terms of what's on the grid is expansion, contraction, flow. That's what I typically am aware of. Okay. And then last thing was when I was reading in the manual about that for us, it was... because I love flow and so forth, but I also saw that it was like don't forget to stay in, you know, see here and feel rest, focus out. And focus out and focus in just because there's subtle levels that you don't want to... you know, that you're still needing to process. I understand. So it's okay to have sort of a main practice. But if you're familiar with the whole grid, I encourage people at least occasionally to touch base with other things just to get some balance. But that's just a light suggestion. If you're not familiar with the whole grid, obviously you can't do that. But let's say you're familiar with the whole thing. I think it's... a lot of people have a single thing that they do that's their main practice. And if you are familiar with this other stuff, I think it's useful to touch base at least occasionally with it for rounding purposes. But if you're not familiar with the whole grid, then you just can have just one practice. But remember that one of the ways you push the envelope is by... if there's a particular approach that you like, you see, well, can you maintain it in motion and then in daily life, etc. So maybe you could get a lot of flow when you're sitting, but can you actually get it while you're talking to people and driving the car? That's a way of pushing the envelope with the practice.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.32, "text": " Out of curiosity, what strategy do you generally employ using your technique?", "tokens": [5925, 295, 18769, 11, 437, 5206, 360, 291, 5101, 3188, 1228, 428, 6532, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 11.32, "end": 13.32, "text": " You mean as I'm laughing around in the world?", "tokens": [509, 914, 382, 286, 478, 5059, 926, 294, 264, 1002, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 13.32, "end": 15.32, "text": " No, not on the cushion.", "tokens": [883, 11, 406, 322, 264, 21908, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 15.32, "end": 17.32, "text": " Oh, on the cushion?", "tokens": [876, 11, 322, 264, 21908, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 4, "seek": 0, "start": 17.32, "end": 18.32, "text": " Yeah.", "tokens": [865, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 5, "seek": 0, "start": 18.32, "end": 22.32, "text": " Mostly both God.", "tokens": [29035, 1293, 1265, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 6, "seek": 0, "start": 22.32, "end": 26.32, "text": " Simultaneous expansion, contraction, and their vanishing.", "tokens": [3998, 723, 15447, 11260, 11, 37372, 11, 293, 641, 3161, 3807, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 7, "seek": 0, "start": 26.32, "end": 27.32, "text": " So flow and...", "tokens": [407, 3095, 293, 485], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4471516242394081, "compression_ratio": 1.4216216216216215, "no_speech_prob": 0.03249025344848633}, {"id": 8, "seek": 2732, "start": 27.32, "end": 35.32, "text": " Well, both.
