{"text": " So I'm Stephanie Nash and I am here talking with Locke Kelly. Hi Locke. Hey, how are you doing Stephanie? Good to see you. We met at the International Dharma Teacher Gathering. That's right. I remember you swimming in the pond in the lake in the morning. And he did a wonderful workshop there that gave a couple of exercises I really liked and I used for the next year. I come from Shenzhen and I kind of used some of his things but in another neat, simple, direct way I liked a lot. And we're in LA now. And Locke just did a workshop that I attended yesterday and we thought we would talk about that and stuff. I do want to say the workshop was offered by Compassion LA and it's a group here that offers workshops that work with compassion and awakening wisdom workshops. And their website is CompassionLA.org. So there's my plug for the people who brought him here and thank you to them for that work. And so I just wanted to talk to you about what it is we were doing yesterday with these exercises. I'm intrigued by your style of directing. You're not telling people to go off and meditate for 10 hours and maybe at some point you can reach nirvana or samadhi or oneness with the universe. You have some really interesting exercises and that work with open-hearted. Open-hearted, what is open-hearted? So open-hearted awareness, so the non-profit institute that I'm part of is Open-Hearted Awareness Institute. And do they have a dot-com or dot-org? We have a website that's under EffortlessMindfulness.org or LockeKelley.org. I like effortless mindfulness. I like anything effortless. So the effortless is not that you make no effort, but that you discover that there's an awareness that's already effortlessly aware. And that I think is kind of the missing piece in the map in Western culture and is often in even Buddhism and other meditation systems. It's put off into kind of an esoteric or, well, you really can't access that immediately. You've got to wait three years, 30 years, three lifetimes. Yes, you say a few lifetimes later. Meanwhile, those who do have an awakening, whether it's intentional or unintentional, report back to us that it's already here and it's already available within us. So that's the premise that I was told. And then as a curious American New Yorker, I said, well, wait a minute then. If it's already here and it's accessible, let's check it out. Let's see if we can, are there groups and approaches and people and teachings that start or do a little more of accessing this, recognizing and realizing this in the midst of daily life rather than going off to a monastery. So that's the premise. Which is key. Because have you been to a monastery lately? Well, I mean, it's great, but we can't all do that. Yes. And for those who do that, that's another approach. But is there another approach? And what I discovered in kind of traveling around and being interested in this world of meditation, psychology, and eventually the talk I gave at Dharma Teachers was on neuroscience and meditation and awakening. So really bringing kind of contemporary approach of scientific inquiry, which means what's true, what works, what's actually happening. Are people really getting this? Is this an imagination or is this really changing people's lives in a way that they're not only waking up, but they're growing up. That's a kind of maturity, integrity, compassion. Is this possible? And I think where I am now is that it really is possible in the midst of daily life. It's almost like the next natural stage of human development. Evolution. Yeah. So it's evolution and potential. It's esoteric only in that means that it's paradoxical, meaning it's not the normal way we learn something by using our minds or informational is not the way you learn this. It's more like feeling how you ride a bicycle. Did you come up with this way of presenting things or did you study with somebody who did it? Because you have some simple exercises that like I don't think I've ever been to a workshop or a presentation where someone just said, okay, we talked for a moment about stuff, but then it's like, okay, let's try this. Okay, feel that? Feel that? And everyone's like, and literally three minutes later, everyone's reporting the adjectives. I said as a teacher, it's like a high five. It's like everyone's reporting all these adjectives of openness, freedom, peace, various things they got just from trying something right there in that moment. Now, did you develop these techniques? In looking from the beginning for what is the goal? What is the result? What is this thing that people call awakening or what is that about? What does that give you? What does that mean? What changes? What's absent? What's present? I started following that interesting premise to see who it is that was talking about this. And so then I kind of went around from Zen to Vipassana to Tibetan Buddhism, both the Dzogchen and the Maha Mudra, which is really where I ended up. Many of the practices are based on Maha Mudra, but some are Advaita, some are from Taoism. But there's a... And you can see that thread through them all. And some are just... and then once you start to have a shift into this, what's called recognition or realization, then it's kind of like awareness shows itself to itself. So there starts to be this curious, almost like a way that, oh, well, wait a minute. First I'm here and I'm contracted and identified, and then I'm open, and then the openness is denied, and then the openness is open-hearted, and then it's related. But now I'm stuck in here, but now I'm stuck, I'm blissed in, I'm spaced out. So how do I get from here to here? And is there an intentional way, or is that efforting kind of a doing that keeps you from letting go? So those kind of curious questions, but I didn't approach it intellectually. I approached it like a palpable, experiential experiment. Like let's find out, let's do it, let's find the way to shift into it and find a way to live from it in the middle of, for me, New York City. So I'm like, might as well go. That's where I started. You can do it there. That's what I said. If you can walk down the street there, you've got it. Yeah. You can do it in the subway, and it works just as well. That was the beginning of my practices in New York, yeah. It's a great opportunity. So you did put this together yourself. One thing that I'm especially intrigued by, because physicality is something that I'm very active with, the kind of embodied person, and I do a lot of movement, and I work with a lot of physical modalities and posture for meditation, and how we communicate with our body and how we can allow our body to move in certain ways that affects how we think and feel. Right. And you, in this development, as you were pulling from all these ingredients and cooking your own stuff, you actually came up with kind of movements. It's a physical way. You have a journey from being in here to the heart, and you just talked about that progression. Yes, that's right. And then it's really, you ended up having us do an exercise, actually, literally moving from here to here, to the heart, to out. And you had physical movements we did, which I thought, for me personally, I thought there were two levels this learning goes in. In addition, someone can say something, you can hear it, you can conceptualize it, you can even try moving your focus around. But when you add this physicality, for me, once I'm physically moving, it's like a mudra or something, it goes in my body in a different way with just a physical, you're just using hands and arms to kind of help us bring us into it. But I liked that physical commitment to it. And the second was watching it. You'll be up there and I was saying, it's like he's conducting with his body, fluid, very fluid movement. And now you're doing it. I know, I feel like, I talk a lot with my hands anyway. But, you know, because we hear things and that's one, I was mentioning this, that's one part of the brain, but then we see you do it and visually we get an impression. So there's the physical, the feeling, we hear the words and then we see it. And so I thought it is a way of, your whole approach is about, let's just do this right now there, feel it. And so, and it goes in, in those three different modalities, you see here, feel is something that, you know, I'm trained in those being our three primary sanskrit. So I was very, I was impressed, but I liked, it was fun. It makes it as opposed to, I am going now, I'm going to, I got to get enlightened by two o'clock. It was really fun. I enjoyed this very much. So, and your personality is also, you can get Woody Allen-y sometimes. Or other, you had other comedy people you were doing in there. But so you want to talk about this physicality of it a little bit? Yeah, I mean, one, you know, like you, I've also been, you know, always been kind of physical and played a lot of sports. So I would say, you know, one little story would be, one way that I discovered this was that I was an ice hockey goalie. Oh, were you? How are your knees? Yeah, they're okay. Okay. I think the sitting on the cushion was worse for me. My nephew was an ice hockey goalie. So I had discovered the way that I played best was I would shift into another mode of perception. And then I heard on TV, somebody talking, a commentator talking about a quarterback, and they said, he's got eyes in the back of his head. And I was like, you know, 14. So I was like, he's got eyes in the back of the head. How do you do that? How do you get that? So I literally started developing this way. I thought, okay, well, I can go this far. Let me continue bringing my awareness around this way. And as soon as I brought my awareness around to this 360 degree panoramic awareness, I opened up my panoramic and peripheral vision, and then I dropped down into my body and there became this natural, almost field of awareness where I felt like a cat. And then I would just trust from there that, you know, I'd see somebody take a slap shot, but there'd be all these legs. And all of a sudden, I just trust in my hand would shoot out, and the puck would be in there. And I figured, okay, so rather than being hyper vigilant and one pointed in this effort, the efforting mind, learn how to relax, but not relax, like go to sleep. But there's another mode of perceiving that's called, you know, that people know, called the zone or being in the flow. So the flow state, this was 14. This was a 14. 14. You did this? Oh, well, see, he took it a long time. Yeah. And, you know, so I felt this and then I was explaining it to a friend who actually lives in LA and is going to come over. Oh, the web? Yeah. And I was saying like, you know, well, you know, I said, how'd you do that, man? You know, and I started to put it into words. And he was like, Oh, cool. Great. Happy for you. This is one of your. Okay. Didn't really want to. I really want that information. I have no idea what you're talking about. I was just asking you like, you know, you know, just say something normal, you know, but so then but then one of the seniors on the team overheard me and the next week he came in and gave me this book, Zen and the Art of Archery. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He said, here kid, this is what you were talking about. Wow. Yeah. I mean, at that age, he was new to read that. Yeah. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. When I was at Duke in the art class, she never told us how to paint. She just sat there reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. That's what we were like trying to paint. She might come over and go, you know, see that there. And she'd go back and read it. But that's and then I did Zen and the Art of Archery. Oh, that is so interesting. Yeah. Well, what was, you know, this panoramic vision and that is key to what you do. But then the dropping down into the body part. Now, what made you at the age of 14 go because you just had to do something. That's why you thought to. I felt that shift that when you open and then are doing something physical, that all of a sudden the feeling is as if you're in every cell of your body. And the center is more like your gut, your dantian or your heart. And you actually are optimally functioning without thinking about thinking. So all that information is processed in. And then I realized, OK, people talk about it in certain activities like sports or art. But can we do this in everyday life, in relating and creating? Because often you'll see sports stars who get in the zone when they come out of it. They're actually the opposite. Or you'll see artists or writers who can get in the zone and then all of a sudden their life is a mess because the rest they don't feel the way they feel. And that's so you almost become compulsively addicted to that, which takes you out of it. So I know I there are many actors who when they're acting, they feel so alive. That's right. And they will wait tables and, you know, do things for the rest of life just to get another few minutes of that hit of that high. And what I try to say is a meditation teacher that's available in each moment. But they think, no, I have to be on stage. You know, they get that zone experience. Two things come to mind. One was the way I understood that samurai were trained was that they're not looking at where their opponent is or where the weapon is. They actually go into a broad focus where they're not even looking at them. They're literally just kind of in you go into an almost feeling of the environment. And it's this kind of broad focus. And I remember playing with that myself and realizing that there were times in which I was doing that driving can be one. Sometimes in driving, I'm just watching the kind of movement of everything, the flow of the visual field. But what naturally happens is this extension out into space in a way where I'm part of the space. Yes. You know, I'm just one of the elements moving in it. But this relational experience with everything, it's like we're all one organism and I'm one part of this larger organism. But this getting back and bringing it into the body part. I do find that what's wonderful is that mindfulness is coming into the Western world and it's a revolution in a sense is starting there. And that's my hope for our planet at this time. But often the way in, it is we are minds, you know, it's how we're thinking. And the embodied aspect of it is sometimes just left out. That's right. Yeah. And that's something that's so important to me. And one of the reasons, one of the reasons I adore what you do, it's just, you know, what you do is really like my style. I love it. But that you have said every time, you'll say, you talk about that panoramic awareness and then bringing it into the body. And you know, I think of it as including like, you know, kind of the way I just described it. But it's wonderful that you make that in your journey that, no, it's got to happen. And so could you just talk about that progression a little more? Yeah. So, you know, often when people start with mindfulness, you know, which is wonderful for stress relief and for kind of traditional preliminary practices. And relaxation. And relaxation. That's the aspect of the body people will like. That's right. But that some of the tools of the initial preliminary practices are actually one pointed focus using the attention of the moving mind. And yet the effortless mindfulness or more advanced practice, you actually have to learn the other set of skills. You have to learn not only opening your awareness so that you're in the zone and trusting this non-conceptual intelligence that is not checking with thought constantly and is not a quick mind but actually is a mind that is made of more spacious awareness. So the kind of... So the Dzogchen, Mahamudra. Mahamudra or even Zen, Big Sky Mind, you know, this kind of thing. And that the small sense of self which is made of or the ego center which is made of thought referring to thought and creates a little character looking out of your eyes that feels like it's looking out of your eyes and feels like it's an entity. He does a lot of funny riffs on that. That that, you know, that is one way of functioning. That's one way of operating. But it's the little thought based ego center is just too small to deal with a full emotional life, a full life of intimacy and, you know, and joy in the world. So we're not just... So I realized that often the first step of stepping out of this ego center and into kind of either a meditative state or even a bigger pure awareness is only partway there but often important. And the usual progression is calm, use focus to calm or calm to focus and then that will calm the chattering mind and then to open up your meditative awareness or discover that there's kind of a bigger, more open mind, open heart which is literally the feeling you get, not an intellectual idea. And then you're kind of... so the way I have people move is actually to feel like awareness can unhook from thought and then open to the space. And then unhook from thought. He always puts it that way and I like that very much. It's like, it's doing it just on the hook. It's very... It's just like he just says it and everyone goes, oh, okay. Yeah. And I thought it was so perfect. And I keep going. And one of the strange premises that I realized, I didn't even realize I was doing in the beginning. I thought in the beginning, well, okay, but yeah, the one who's unhooking is not the doer, is not the ego that's unhooking. But then I just kind of kept going and then I realized, oh, I see what I'm doing. I'm actually asking the awake person the awareness that they already are, that they've already been to unhook awareness from thought and that that awareness or that awake, empty, lucid clarity has a life already and actually has the ability to move and has a kind of intentionality. It isn't just passive. And that often it's been defined as this passive, you know, recognition of awake awareness that you just sit in a meditative state and it's lovely and it's free of suffering. But then one day back to work from a long day retreat and you have the only option you have is operating from ego center. So this is really about upgrading the operating system. Our little tech dropped. Got to apply it. But literally stepping out of the current little small sense of self, opening to space and then discovering that the awareness actually is discovering an aware mind, what's called nature of mind, big sky mind, pure awareness that is already aware and has already been aware both outside and then. And before you go on, and there's someone could never have. I just want to say this. This isn't just like, hi, I've been on the spiritual path for 12 years now. Now I'm trying chapter number 17. Someone could walk in and have never done anything and go through this. So it's appealing kind of directly in that way. But one thing I want to say about when you're talking about big sky mind, there's a space. I want to just kind of emphasize the spatiality of it that we're here. No we're not. You really get the sense that no, you are. So that sense of that extended space of self. I just wanted to, for someone who could just walk in there and go, oh, my awareness is that big. How can that be? And again, he takes you right there experientially like into second. So but now continue on. Yeah. And just to say what you're saying, because it's the most important point is that this awakeness that's both embodied and open hearted is already here. And it's a consciousness that's already installed in us. It doesn't have to be developed or created. But we haven't known how to access it. So that's been my whole project. It's like, wait a minute. Why do you have to do this and this and this to get to here? Because once I'm here, let me feel what it's like to lose it. And then let me go back and shift back into it. Oh, well, I didn't have to do those eight things to get back. Let me see what is the map of consciousness experientially? And then how do you navigate it? And then how do you translate it to somebody and make the language more contemporary and more experiential? So that's kind of what I've been doing is like translating, translating, translating, not just text. But yeah, like what's your New Yorker direct get it is it here? Just get to the point, right? You know, let's go do what's needed and no more. Yeah. And do it like you learn, you know, you know, you know, take care of your consciousness the way you learn to eat or whether you go to the gym or you do, you know, yoga posture. It's like sometimes I call it the yoga of awareness. So it's but the interesting thing is, which is what I'm coming back to now is that what it is that's moving and what it is that knows this ground, which is pure awareness, is only awareness. And that's why most people have missed it is because we're trying to effort it. We're using our will. We're using our mind. And we're even using attention of the mind, which which actually can't see it, nor can mindful witnessing see the pure awareness. So even that which pulls back and is able to observe thought can't turn around. It's actually has to be that which is already made of the non local awareness that's locally attached or identified. That can drop that can open from thought and then discover itself as kind of non local awareness and be aware of itself without thought and without senses just from it just doesn't have to do it that long. It doesn't have to be a long retreat or half hour meditation. It just needs to plug in or surrender or tune in to that which has already been aware. And then as that which is aware, the next important move is the intentionality realizes Oh, form is emptiness. Now emptiness is form. So the awareness realizes it's aliveness and the feeling of the ocean appearing as waves of consciousness is where you drop back in and you have a it's like you've shifted figure ground of what's awake, what you're aware of, then you can be aware of all your thoughts, feelings, sensations, but you're aware from this huge, loving, supportive inside outside is the same. And you're free of the anxious, perpetually dissatisfied commentator. That's it, we can just stop right now. That's pretty much it. Yeah, yeah, God, so many things I want to say. And then one more thing is that so then when there's this embodied kind of continuous field of awareness that's primary, you the anxious, the anxiety is gone about anxiousness and the judging, but you still have your full range of emotions. You're not detached. You're going to start walking into walls or anything. You're actually in a flow state, which is more optimally functioning. And you've dropped not only into your body, but you've dropped from head to heart mind. So it's a feeling that people even if I don't describe it, they say, and I love the term heart mind. Yeah, it's juicy. What I was going to just say two things real quick. One was when you just described that, and I thought it, but you talked about the kind of loving support of it. And I remember I came up to him after, oh, in an intermission, or maybe it was after the Friday night. Okay, and you did? Yes. And I said when he was describing it, and I thought, you know, I, when I first learned Buddhism, and they're talking about refuge, I thought that's what they were talking about. Because I thought that is the ultimate refuge. Yes, and it is the ultimate refuge that even in Buddhism, you start with Buddha, and then you start with or you start with your guru or your teacher, take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and then you start, you know, with and then you realize, oh, the teachers outside, oh, no, the teachers inside. And then some Tibetans do like, oh, there's a deity, but then the deity melts into you. And then you arises that. So ultimately, it is in the systems, ultimately, the refuge is the Tao or the Buddha nature, true nature. It's like a direct path to the ultimate refuge.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.84, "text": " So I'm Stephanie Nash and I am here talking with Locke Kelly.", "tokens":
