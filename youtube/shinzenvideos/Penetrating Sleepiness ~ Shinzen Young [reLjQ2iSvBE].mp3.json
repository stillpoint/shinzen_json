{"text": " For the sleepiness stuff, well, read and reread until you master completely what I have to say in the blog from fuzz to buzz. That's on the internet and that's the brain dump of everything that I know for how to work with syncing. So syncing is the generic term for anything from getting a little hazy in your consciousness to the zemlurge and the, you know, the snoring in the zendo and so forth. That whole continuum we call syncing. Konjin in Japanese means, kon means dark and jin means to like sink down to the bottom of the pond. So konjin is like sinking in English. So for syncing over and over again, straighten the spine, over and over again, force the eyes open, over and over again, enjoy the pleasant restfulness of the waves of sleepiness, over and over again, equanimize the discomfort of the sleepiness. And you just keep doing that and doing that and doing that. And I know it's hard to believe and I certainly didn't believe it, but you can eventually penetrate the sensory event of sleepiness. And when you do that, then that's a sensory experience and there's the objective circumstance of, you know, you're wilting, you're lurching and you're breathing heavily, etc. When you penetrate the sensory event of sleepiness, then the objective aspects of the sleepiness, the loss of consciousness, the impact on the posture and the fact that you start to make noise, that all gets cleared up. I remember one of my early retreats in Japan, of course, I was dominated by the pain of the sitting and I went to talk to the person that was like leading the retreat and he said, I've been meditating, this is him talking, I've been meditating now for 25 years and, you know, eventually the pain breaks up. But then he said sleepiness is very hard to deal with. The pain is going to break up, but sleepiness may continue to be a challenge. Well, now that conversation took place 40 years ago and I can tell you that the sleepiness breaks up too. Just keep working and working and working and you'll see improvements in that regard.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.88, "text": " For the sleepiness stuff, well, read and
