{"text": " There's one other experience that was very dramatic. When I did my first retreat in the U Ba Khin method, which is body sweeping, at that time I'd had a ten year very intense addiction to marijuana, but they won't let you use substances, which is fine. I obeyed that. I was sweeping through my body and I noticed this very subtle little discomfort around my lungs and whatever. No big deal, but I knew it was sort of associated with maybe all the smoke I was putting in there. But nothing intense, no thoughts about it or whatever. When I came back from that retreat, apparently the part of my body that was enjoying the marijuana and the part of my body that was being damaged by the marijuana communicated below the threshold of awareness because I had sort of clarified the body for the body. It had nothing to do with my mind whatsoever. But when I went home, that addiction disappeared spontaneously and never came back. That was very impressive. It's like, wow. I didn't have to struggle. There was no on the wagon, off the wagon kind of stuff of struggling with it. It was gone. My body had decided. Was this before or after the No Boundaries? After. The No Boundaries doesn't guarantee that your bad habits go away. You spend the rest of your life refining yourself. So I would say, yeah, those four over a period of 40 years, that's like one per decade. Those are good ones though.
