{"text": " Shenzhen gives an example when he started doing music meditation. He gave an example, he refers people to your iPod a lot. Would you just explain a little bit about what's happening on your iPod and why Shenzhen is referring them to you? Sure. Music is very, very important in my life. When my house is empty, I fill it with music. Not always, but when you have a household of people and they leave, it's like, I can listen to my own music now. So I found, I love classical music, and when he teaches the music meditation, he will use a technique of vanishing or gone. He uses the rest, and he uses the active states. I don't know if we're still using that term, but active states. So what I did is I went through my classical music and I categorized it. Things that had, for instance, the gone, you know, there's moments when there's no sound. And so then you can note the gone. So I have about four or five pieces on my iPod that I've labeled meditation, music, gone. And then I have four or five pieces that are rest states, and four or five pieces for pure sound. Now, somebody else might not find those pure sound, but to me, they fill me so that I can just be the sound. And I've actually loaned my iPod to many people, and they've taken them off. So I especially use it when I'm flying. I was just going to say, how are you using it primarily? When I'm flying, when I want to relax, when I want pure sound and just be the music, to take myself out of the marketplace, that's when I use it.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 19.0, "text": " Shenzhen gives an example when he started doing music meditation.", "tokens": [1160, 11368, 2932, 2709, 364, 1365, 562, 415, 1409, 884, 1318, 12537, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3574095707313687, "compression_ratio": 1.39568345323741, "no_speech_prob": 0.34133121371269226}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 19.0, "end": 23.0, "text": " He gave an example, he refers people to your iPod a lot.", "tokens": [634, 2729, 364, 1365, 11, 415, 14942, 561, 281, 428, 5180, 378, 257, 688, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3574095707313687, "compression_ratio": 1.39568345323741, "no_speech_prob": 0.34133121371269226}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 23.0, "end": 27.0, "text": " Would you just explain a little bit about what's happening on your iPod", "tokens": [6068, 291, 445, 2903, 257, 707, 857, 466, 437, 311, 2737, 322, 428, 5180, 378], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3574095707313687, "compression_ratio": 1.39568345323741, "no_speech_prob": 0.34133121371269226}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2700, "start": 27.0, "end": 31.0, "text": " and why Shenzhen is referring them to you?", "tokens": [293, 983, 1160, 11368, 2932, 307, 13761, 552, 281, 291, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.23984336853027344, "compression_ratio": 1.5209302325581395, "no_speech_prob": 0.0003296214563306421}, {"id": 4, "seek": 2700, "start": 31.0, "end": 36.0, "text": " Sure.
