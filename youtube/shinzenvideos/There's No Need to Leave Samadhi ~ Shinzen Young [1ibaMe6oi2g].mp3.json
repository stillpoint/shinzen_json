{"text": " I was talking about when I first learned how to practice. My first teacher was this like samurai actually. He was really macho in the way he talked. He was the president of the sumo club. I mean he wasn't himself built like that but the sumo club are the students at the university that do sumo and he was the advisor. Usually those kinds of people are sort of quasi militaristic types you know get into the martial arts and things like that. So what he would do is when at the end of each set you know ring the bell to end the set. Just before you ring the bell you'd be sitting there for an hour right. It was Zen you know it was the whole Zen thing. Although he was a Shingon monk by lineage but he trained in the Zen tradition. Just before he'd hit the bell he'd deliver like some sort of one-line zinger sound bite and then like hit the bell you know. It was like really dramatic and it would and because you're in the really deep state you know it's like it's brainwashing right. You're being indoctrinated because it really hits you right. So I remember but it's good brainwashing. I'm very grateful that I had that. So I remember once it was like we're all sitting on this. But what it means is the samadhi that you go into and come out of is not samadhi. Meaning so took me years to really understand. I thought I understood what he meant but I didn't really understand what he meant. I thought what he meant is okay stay in these states all the time which is true. I mean that's part of what he meant. But the deeper understanding is that when you're in a certain state and it's time to start taking care of business whatever business is. Go to the washroom or drive to work or you know make breakfast. You're in this something and now it's time to act. The tendency is to want to in some way go back to the normal way of being and then okay I'm gonna function. It's like okay well that was that was great but now let's get back to the real world. And the trick is to just not do that. Whatever function needs to arise simply happens from that state. You channel whatever doing needs to be done and if that causes fear or disorientation you equanimize it and you throw caution to the wind and you just function. And that's one of the ways that that Zen bounce is trained. So I would say when that happens if you have to transition to some action, fine just you know you don't leave, you may come out of Samadhi but you don't need to leave Samadhi in order to function. And if you come out, why do you come out? You come out because the inner system reactivates and if you see where that reactivation comes from you actually see the self being born from the non-self. Then you're just fine. There's no difficulties whatsoever in integrating. I don't know if that was what you were asking about. Okay I think we're good for now.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.84, "text": " I was talking about when I first learned how to practice.
