{"text": " Right. The question is if you had a tape and you listen to it with reverence, from my perspective it would be, but I'm not sure from an Indian's perspective it would be. Traditionally, they are quite adamant against recording any religious thing. That means photography, video, or audio. They really don't like that. In fact, when you go into a sun dance in a sun dance camp, there's what's called aakichita. Aakichita are the camp police. They're just ordinary people that volunteer to be the camp police. I mean, if you went to a sun dance and you raised your hand, you'd be part of the camp police. But one of the things the camp police make sure is that no one has brought anything like that into the camp. You have to leave that at the gate, so to speak. They do not like photographs. They do not like tape recordings, that kind of thing. It's been done, though. It's been done by good singers. The tapes are good. Maybe it's been done to educate the younger Indians who have been culture sided, but the fact is the tapes are commercially available. It is also the fact that a lot of traditional Indians would really cringe at the thought of having these songs on tape or for that matter, even romanizing them. So it's really your decision. A lot of things in the Indian path are up to you kind of thing. Do women dance in sun dance? However, there is one difference. They don't pierce the same way that men pierce. Men pierce through the chest or the back. Women pierce through the arms with eagle feathers, not with the big skewers that the men use. But other than that, they dance the same dance in the same arbor. With the men? With the men. The women dance on the women's side. The men dance on the men's side. However, that is the modern sun dance. What has happened is, as with everything else, the culture is subject to culture change and it has to respond to circumstances. Sun dance was originally a man's ceremony. In fact, it's a man's ceremony of imitating women. During the sun dance, you wear a skirt. It's actually a sarong kind of thing. And the symbolism of being skewered and then tied by ropes through those skewers to the tree is the symbolism of the umbilical cord. And you imitate the pain that the woman goes through in giving birth. But it's a spiritual rebirth and you must tear loose either by being hung from that tree or by pulling back with your own strength, basically dancing backwards from the tree. In either one of those ways, you have to tear loose. You make your offering of flesh that way. But the symbolism is that you experience the pain of birth partly to repay the woman nation, but also it's a symbolism of spiritual birth of a new self by putting yourself in a near-death experience of the four days of excruciating exhaustion and thirst. So it was a man's dance. But in the modern sun dance, women dance. Women with children? Oh yeah, as far as I know. In fact, children dance. It's really neat to see kids out, little ones. My friend's daughter started the sun dance when she was 13 years old. And they pierce people? Children can pierce. They pierce children. I'll explain in a minute. Could you do me a favor? There's a sentient being in here that I don't want to die. It's not that I mind that he's drinking what I got, but I don't want him to drown. When you make a commitment to sun dance, you pledge that you will dance for four years in succession. After that, it's up to you if you continue to dance or not. But you must do four years, nothing less than four years. A sun dance is a four-day ceremony. Sun dance is a four-day ceremony of dancing. It's preceded by four days of sweat lodge and other ceremony to prepare you. It's followed by four days of savoring the afterglow and resting. So actually, it's a 12-day ceremony altogether. But the centerpiece is four days, and you must dance for four years. Fred is a senior sun dancer. He's one of these people that heals pretty well, so you don't see the scars too much. But I think he's danced about 18 times. Here's what happens. Most people, if you sun dance for four years, you probably want to sun dance for the rest of your life. Perhaps I should describe to some of you that may not know what a sun dance is. Well, let me first describe the progression, how people get involved. What typically happens is you start out with sweat lodges. So for many of you that have not been involved in the Native Path, you're getting your start. That's how I started. You start coming to sweats. That's typical. After you've been sweating for a while, it may happen that you're given a pipe, and you start to learn how to use a pipe and how to be focused with the pipe. After you've done that for a while, a while in this case could mean four, five, six, seven years, they'll ask you to go on a vision quest. Vision quest means that you go up on a hill, and for four days and four nights, you just sit in a very circumscribed area. You put tobacco ties all around you, make like a fence of tobacco ties, and you sit there for four days. No food, no water, no shelter. If possible, if you can do it, no sleep. If you need to sleep, okay, you lie down. But you're completely alone. And they call it haamblechaya in the Lakota language. That means crying for a vision. Crying for a dream, literally, is what it means. Ha means a dream. A haamble is a dream vision, and chaya means to cry. Haamblechaya. It's one of the seven Lakota ceremonies. So you haamblechaya for four days. And during those four days, you make a big sacrifice, very hard. You're left completely alone. You've never had the experience of watching the sun come up and go down, and the moon come up and go down, and that be all there is. Even though you've lived on this planet low those many years, you never saw the complete cycle, okay, what that is. So you see that for four days and no water. Fasting is a sacrifice, but thirsting is a much deeper sacrifice. And you experience all four seasons, almost guaranteed. You'll boil one day, you'll freeze at night some other time. You have no shelter. You'll experience perfect times that are like spring and autumn. And the forces of nature will talk to you out there in the form of vision. What's the difference between a vision and a hallucination? A vision is something that transforms you, that has meaning for you. They do a sweat for you before you go up on the hill, and you sit in the sweat. And the night before that, they give you a feast. Fred did this for me. He was my vision quest master. And at the feast before you go up, you can have anything you want, because you're going to have to go for four days. So you can order anything you want. And then I didn't ask for anything special, but everything tasted awful good. Then the next morning they give a sweat. Everybody wishes you well. You smoke a pipe in the sweat. And from that time on, you talk to no one, and you carry nothing. You just have a pipe, and you walk up on the hill. An assistant carries all your things for you. They set you up, and they put you in this little enclosed area. And they give a beautiful blessing on you, touching you. And they leave you. And you cry up there for a vision until something comes to you, something that tells you about how you're going to live your life. Then, after you've been put up on the hill, they may ask you to sun dance, which sort of represents the pinnacle of involvement in the Red Road, as the modern Red Road is, as it is now being practiced among contemporary Indians like Fred, like Wolf. You'll be asked to sun dance by an elder, after you've been around for a long time, if they think you're ready. Clearly, not everybody is going to be ready, even to a hamblechea. But sun dance is a whole other magnitude of sacrifice. They tell you it can't be done. You're supposed to die after three days without water. But little children and old men and people of all races do it for four routinely, without any ill effects. During a sun dance, you dance around a sacred tree. It's a cottonwood tree that's been cut down. It's actually been hunted as though it were an animal and cut down. It made its sacrifice. It's put in the middle of something they call an arbor. Arbor is another one of these special uses of the English language. It doesn't mean what you think. Arbor usually think is an area with trees that shade it. But arbor, there is a shade arbor, which is like a ramada that's around where the supporters are. But the center arbor, the dancing arbor, is exposed to the sun. And in the middle of that arbor is the tree. And around the tree are literally thousands of prayer ties. That is to say, tobacco that is wrapped in colored cloth that somebody has said a prayer on when they wrapped it. Literally thousands of these from the dancers and all of their supporters are wrapped around the tree to where you can hardly even see the tree. And you dance around that tree in a very simple step movement without food or water with some rest and rest at night. And while you do this, you're meditating. You're praying. You're connecting. Now it's interesting how the concentration is built. The singers are singing all the time. They've got big drums, the kind of drums that eight people can sit around. And you have singers under the shade arbor that are singing. And they're singing the song, some of which you'll hear in the lodge. While they sing, you dance in rhythm. Now there's a downbeat. Usually if you listen to the beat of Indian songs, you'll hear there's a strong beat, light beat, strong beat, light beat like that. So there's a downbeat. So it's like, da da da da da da, yaaah, like that. So on each beat of the drum, you raise and lower your feet. So it's a very simple step. And you sort of bounce in between like this. And on the downbeat of the drum, you blow through an eagle bone whistle. You breathe out through the eagle bone whistle. It's a whistle made from the bone of an eagle, the wing bone of an eagle. When you get an eagle bone whistle, you realize what an awesome bird an eagle is. Because, I mean, it's not like a chicken bone. It's more like an ox bone or something. It's like thick, you know. And the whistles are, they're notched. And there's a little feather at the end of the whistle. When you blow through it, it makes a high tone and a low tone. And on each downbeat of the music, you breathe out through the eagle bone whistle. So it gives this pee, pee, pee sound like that. And of course, it's calling the spirit. But there's something else it's doing. Every dancer has to listen to everybody else's whistle. Those whistles have to be in perfect sync. So your body is in perfect, your movement of the body is in perfect sync to that music. Your breath is perfectly coordinated with everybody else's breath because the tones overlap. So not only are you breathing at the same time, you're breathing in exactly the same pattern as everyone else is. No, no. In your hands, you have, typically you have an eagle's wing that you use as a fan. The eagle bone whistle, you take rawhide or not rawhide, yeah, something like rawhide, and you tie around it at the end. So it gives a flange of leather and it just hangs limply between your teeth. It takes no effort whatsoever. And you don't really blow the whistle. You simply breathe out on the downbeat of the music. Your eye is fixated either at the sky, the sun, or the tree at all times. And if your eyes wander, there are helpers that circulate around that say, look at the tree, brother. Okay? So for four days, your body is moving with the music, your breath is in perfect sync with everyone else, and your eye does not wander. It depends on the size of the dance. It can be a few dozen to 60 people or 100 people. Yes. In the ways that I've seen, you sleep at night. I have heard that some tribes did not sleep at night or do not sleep at night. They dance four days without rest. I simply do not understand that. I mean, I cannot conceive of it. It's a supreme ordeal to do it with rest. I just don't know how it's done without rest. But there are, I'm not sure, but I think, I think the Utes and Shoshones may do it without rest, but I don't think they pierce. I'm not sure about that. But the Lakotas, you do rest, at least in the contemporary Sundance. I don't know about olden times. They were a lot stronger physically in older days. I mean, you know, these Sundancers, we're not talking about Olympian athletes here. We're talking about people that are typically ex-alcoholics, ex-drug users, grew up on Coca-Cola and fry bread, are overweight, and chain smokers, is your typical Sundancer. What I just described, we're not talking about something out of Dances with Wolves. We're talking about the reality of modern Indians. Okay. What I just described to you is your typical Sundancer. They're able to do it. Why? Because it transcends our logical way of thinking about things. Something happens in those ceremonies that is beyond the physics of our body. You become very focused as you're dancing. You have discomforts that you greet with equanimity, and you pray, whatever prayer means for you. Whether it's having conversation with the Great Spirit, whether it's talking and seeing your ancestors, your dead relative, whether it's communicating with spirits, because remember, there's the three levels. And I'll tell you, if you want to get to that intermediate level, okay, four days without food or water and not much rest, you know you're going to have some visions. You know you're going to see some spirits there. You're going to plunge into those depths of your being. There's something else that happens, and this is a little hard for people to understand. If I describe it to you in the simple anatomical reality of it, it will sound grotesque and off-putting. But when you see it, it's done with great dignity, peace, and beauty. And that's called piercing. The way the men pierce is you're cut typically over the pectoral muscle. It's all done very hygienically. I mean, you know, they know about AIDS and hepatitis, okay, they use sterilized separate blades. But you're cut about an inch, two parallel cuts about an inch apart and about an inch long over each chest. And then skewers of wood that you carve yourself made out of a tree called chokecherry are threaded under your skin and muscle. A little bit of muscle, mostly skin. As I say, it sounds, I see some people are already wincing, but when you see it done, okay, you lie down on a beautiful buffalo hide and it's your friends that are piercing you, someone you really trust. And they hold fresh sage right over your nose. The odor of the sage is so heady that it just completely relaxes you. Everybody is very relaxed. If you saw that movie, A Man Called Horse, they show him being pierced in there, okay. They make him sun dance. But in there it's done as a display of macho. And when they pierce him and they hang him and you see his skin stretching like that, which is what happens, okay, it stretches a foot before it breaks. He screams bloody murder, okay. He just cries out and he screams and he carries on. That is not what happens at a sun dance. It is the exact opposite. People get very peaceful, very still, very relaxed. And it's very beautiful. So you've got these skewers through your body and the ends of the skewers are sticking out. Those are attached to thongs and that's attached to a rope that's attached to the tree. And sometime during the sun dance you have to pierce and then you have to break. You have to get loose, either by your own efforts of pulling yourself loose or they have four people, they throw the rope over the tree and four of the biggest guys they can find pull you up and you hang until the skin breaks. Now I know it sounds, as I say, it sounds horrible, but actually it's a very beautiful moment. And when they hang like that, you have eagle fans in both hands and you just shake them like this and you just fly like an eagle. And of course that also works the muscles and helps break loose. That's called piercing and breaking and that's part of the sun dance. Then you're marked, of course, with very distinctive scars. If you saw dances with wolves, a lot of the people had sun dance scars in there. I don't know if you need to look for it. That's not makeup. It's because so many young Indians do sun dance. Some of them had sun dance. I haven't seen the movie, but Fred told me that he could see the sun dance scars on some of the extras. So that then anybody that has those scars at a ceremony is looked upon as somewhat like a minister. It's sort of an initiation in becoming a minister. And the very last round of the sun dance is incredibly beautiful. When you dance, all your friends are around and anybody that needs support is around. They're with you, maybe dancing with you, but just not in the sun. So maybe you have 60 dancers and 300 people that have been around the arbor imbibing this, what's been going on. The very last round, all the dancers go around and they physically touch every single person that came to that sun dance and they make direct eye contact and you bless. And whatever a screw up you may have been in your former life, okay, and whatever you may eventually become, after four days of that dance, you are ready to bless the people. Okay. And every sun dancer goes around and touches every single of the supporters and makes eye contact. And I remember the first time I went to be a supporter at a sun dance and you got 60 people come and touch you and you're looking into their eyes and you're looking into the eyes of 60 people that have just shared a near-death experience in a spiritual context. And their blood is on you and their bodies are just literally burned black, but their eyes are just bright, bright, shining. It's a very, very impactful experience. You know you're contacting something. You're being blessed. That's a sun dance. Everyone has vision. You can't but have vision. Oh, an order of magnitude. It's taking a, I mean, it's like a three-month retreat rolled into four days. Have to dance again. It depends on the dance. Sometimes just a few minutes, sometimes several hours. You get a couple hours of rest in the afternoon. Yes and no. That actually gets into some complicated things. But usually you pierce and break in the same round. Being tethered to the tree, not necessarily. But if you're an eagle dancer, it is. That's a special kind of sun dancer that makes a special pledge to eagle dance. That person is pierced the first round and they remain tethered to the tree for the four days. They break the last round. They talk to no one and they have no shade whatsoever. And when you go out, I did not eagle dance, but you go out to help the eagle dancers and you fan them off and whatever. And they're out there and they look like those old movies of the people in the concentration camp. I mean, it's a heavy vibe, the ones that stay tethered to the tree. They go through very heavy suffering because there's no shade. There's no letup whatsoever. The sun's a hundred degrees, cloudless sky. The earth will burn your feet. You have to dance barefoot. I mean, some people wear moccasins, but you're supposed to dance barefoot. They dance looking at the tree and the ropes just go from the tree to their body. They're in the same spot. They don't move around. That's right. Okay. I think we've talked enough, huh? Given you some idea of, in the general sense, what these ceremonies are like and more specifically what a few of them are like. So now it's time to do it. We'll go on up and we'll see. Maybe someone could go up and see if they're ready for us yet. Have a volunteer. Let's go up and ask one of the people up there. While we're waiting for that, any last questions? I don't know. 45 minutes to two hours for each group. I'm not really sure. Anything else? Oh, it depends on the individual. Some people don't get much visions. Other people are having them before they even go up on the mountain. Yeah. Sometimes they go up with a specific agenda. In some tribes, for example, here in California, oh no, no, I'm sorry. I mean, up in the Pacific Northwest where they had rather elaborate material culture and more elaborate technology than in other places. One of the things you went for vision questing was to find out what your job was in the tribe. Were you going to be a canoe maker? Were you going to be a fisherman? Were you going to be a shaman? And if you went up there and you didn't get a vision, you literally had no job and you had to live your whole life until you got a vision. You literally didn't have a place in society. In the Lakota culture, on the vision you get during Hablechea, you get a vision of thunder and lightning, what they call the thunderbirds. If you get a vision of thunder and lightning, you have to be a Heoka. You know what a Heoka is? A Heoka is a contrary, somebody that does things the exact opposite of everyone else. See, they have in their culture this idea of the two sides to things. There are certain individuals that have to represent the other side. So they have to do everything the opposite of the way everybody else. And it's real. They really exist. There are Heokas. The first Sundance that I ever saw, there was a Heoka dancing the Sundance. Everybody else wears these really bright, beautiful costumes and he wore like just woven reeds. And he danced backwards for the entire dance. And on the third day of the dance, when you're most thirsty, and it's also the hardest suffering time and the most sacred and serious time. I mean, that's when it's the third day. Fourth day, you know it's going to end. Third day is when things start to get really heavy and people start to freak out and people start to cry and whine and go through some very heavy stuff. I mean, it gets pretty heavy in there. But anyway, on the third day, the Heoka comes out with a bucket of water and starts teasing everyone. Dancing around them, teasing them and pretending he's drinking the water. No, he drank it upside down. He does everything opposite. So when he would drink it, the water would fall on the ground. And he was sprinkling everyone with water and just like tormenting them. In other words, disrupting everything at the most pivotal point of the ceremony, completely disrupting and bringing in the other, the shadow side to use the more, you know, the interim of the 90s. Heoka represents the shadow side. They used to have to ride into warfare backwards. They'd wash themselves with dirt. And in the sweat lodges, they'd say, gee, thank you sweat leader for making those rocks good and cold for us. You know, I hope you have a lousy day is how they'll greet you. They have to do everything backwards. And they do. And some people, even Indians, get real upset with them. But that's their vision. You become Heoka. H-E-Y-O-K-A. Heoka. Yeah. And I'm sure in tribal times they did by this ceremony. And the first thought that went through my mind as I got out, it was not like the sweat we're going to have here, which is going to be a mild sweat. It was an intense sweat. It was very hot. And, you know, I just barely was able to crawl out of the thing and make my way out. And I was lying there on the ground and I just started to chuckle. And this thought went through my head. Oh, so this is what they call primitive religion. And that primitive was like in big quotes. OK, primitive religion. Yeah, right. Primitive. It was so subtle. It was so sophisticated. And it impacted, I mean, perceptibly at each level of the being simultaneously as a single event. In other words, it was like it was so skillfully woven to hit you at all those levels at once. Yeah, right. Primitive. I guess what happened was that clearly a stone knife is more primitive than a metal knife. So when you know that that has to be recognized. So I guess what happened was when the Europeans came, they saw that the material culture was basically more primitive. So they simply assumed that the psychological and spiritual culture was more primitive. So, you know, and this is the this is they labeled it primitive religion. It's absolutely hilarious. I remember two thoughts went through my mind. The first was, you know, oh, yeah, right. Primitive religion. Now, this this is really a great joke. The other thing that went through my mind is I had remembered that many tribes would do these sweats before hunting or other significant activities like dances and things like that. I'd read this in anthropological literature and it always seemed to me to be rather strange. I wondered, why would you wipe yourself out in a sauna type situation before you had to go out and do something strenuous like hunting? It didn't make any sense to me until I actually experienced the sweat lodge. And then when I got out, I mean, I was pretty wiped out. I have to admit, I barely crawled out of that sweat lodge and I was lying there and, you know, whatever. And then. About 10 minutes, 15 minutes passed and I started to feel this energy coming on. OK. And it was like, oh, boy. And I don't think I really don't think I slept much for about three days. Who needs to sleep? You know. And then I realized, of course, this is something you do if you had to go on an expedition or if you were about to do a strenuous activity. It makes perfect sense. You're not wiping yourself out in the sauna. What you're doing is you're purifying consciousness. This is inipi. This is purification lodge. According to the Buddhist theory of consciousness, these sankaras are something like friction in the flow of our six senses. Now, what is the effect of friction in your car if you don't lubricate the engine properly? What impact does that have on consumption of fuel? You're going to use a lot of extra gas, right? Why? Because the parts are rubbing against themselves and that makes heat. The heat doesn't do anything productive. And in fact, it could even damage the engine if too much built up. But it takes energy to make that heat. And that energy is all contained within the fuel of the car. So if the car is not properly lubricated, it has three effects. It uses extra fuel, it makes heat, and it may even damage the car. It shortens the life of the car. Something exactly like that is present within these six senses, which I'd like to remind you are still operating as you're listening to me. You understand what I'm saying? Hearing is happening. Feelings are rising. If you're enjoying what I'm saying, if it's productive, oh, there's some subtle pleasant sensation. If I say something that's confusing or inappropriate or that you disagree with, there'll be unpleasant sensations. Ideas are arising in response to the words I'm speaking. Right now, the six senses are operating and hopefully most of you are continuing to meditate. Don't worry about understanding what I'm saying. It will sink in. The intuitive parts of your being will process everything you need to hear from me. But be very aware how the senses come and pass away. There is in the operation of these six senses that moment by moment give us the sense of self and world something like friction. In Buddhism, it's called klesha or sankara. Klesha means impurity. Sankara means limiting force. The same three effects happen in the flow of consciousness that happen in your car. Heat is produced, the engine is injured, and extra fuel, unnecessary fuel, is consumed in the car. What happens inside us? Whenever there's this friction, and unfortunately the friction is largely unconscious, by the time we've heard, we've already congealed hearing. By the time we've had pain in the body, we've already congealed it into a thing called suffering. By the time we've felt pleasure, we've already congealed it into an object that is less than permanently satisfying. The friction is subtle and subliminal. In any event, it causes the analogy of heat. The friction inside of us, the heat, is suffering, is a sense of unsatisfactoriness, or put alternatively, a lack of a sense of perfection in each moment. A sense of perfection independent of circumstances is the definition of enlightenment. The presence of that friction makes a heat called dukkha in Buddhism suffering. The sense of each moment being less than perfect. It damages the engine. In this case, it means that that subtle friction damages our life. How is it that people in this culture go from passionate love to acrimonious divorce in just five short years? How does that happen? It happens because of the presence of that friction in the mind-body state that arise from interpersonal interaction. That friction causes a suffering in the moment, but it also distorts, just like heat will bend the engine, distort the engine so it doesn't function properly. That friction distorts our life and makes us yell when we merely need to be emphatic, makes us hit when we merely need to yell. That's analogous to damaging the engine. The friction uses up energy. Enormous amounts of life energy go into fighting ourselves without even knowing it. It's the tragedy of our species. The real tragedy is we don't even know it. If you have an engine that is using, you know what, the mechanical efficiency of an engine means? It's the ratio of productive work to the energy consumed. The difference between the productive work and the energy consumed, if you subtract productive work from fuel consumed, what you have left over is the amount of energy that went into heating the engine, which was not productive work, and into distorting the engine, which was harmful. Anybody have any idea of the mechanical efficiency of an ordinary automobile? In other words, its ratio of output of work versus input of fuel energy? I don't know, I'm just wondering. I'm guessing about 80%, 70, 80%. I'm not sure. Engines are not all that efficient, nothing near 90 or 100%. However, when it comes to the human being, I'm afraid it's more like an efficiency of maybe 50%, 40%, I'm not sure. Enormous energy goes into these Sankaras. Fortunately, there's a way of reversing that process. And that way is whenever we bring the qualities of attention and acceptance to the flow of these senses, then we are releasing that friction permanently. Of course, the converse is also true. When we fail to bring the qualities of attention and equanimity to the flow of these six senses, unfortunately we're putting in new gritty particles that represent new friction. So if you do a purification ceremony, in Buddhism we define purification as the breaking up of the Sankaras, the internal friction, what the Buddha called tanha, grasping. One of the results of this is that you're going to get a lot of energy freed up. And if you're living in a primitive life where you have to go out hunting or other strenuous activities, yes, you might well want to go into an intensely challenging physical ceremony before you go out hunting. And it just became completely clear to me, and it would never have been clear by reading any anthropologist's description of native culture. They just tell you, oh, they used to sweat every day. They'd sweat before they hunted. But when you actually experience it, then you understand, aha, yeah, of course, this is what they would do. So if when you go into a sweat lodge or any other ceremony where you have to make a physical sacrifice, if you bring those qualities of awareness and equanimity, then you will find that you get energy that you're not drained, that your level of suffering is diminishing, and that your life is changing. So this is why these ceremonies are purification. The ceremonies themselves are set up to encourage you to be in a state of awareness and acceptance. The ceremonial context is the meditation of the native culture. Those songs you'll be hearing, they're very powerful. They're not like other kinds of singing, because the songs were created by people in altered states of consciousness, and they induce altered states of consciousness. They were created by people that were forced into states of high focus. Therefore, when you listen to that song, you will enter a state of high focus. In Buddhism, we have a practice called strong determination sitting, where we say, I'm going to sit for an hour, two hours, three hours, four hours, no voluntary movement of the body, and just be with what is. Very powerful practice, and I highly encourage you to do it. Of course, to a level that's appropriate, not to damage the body or something. Well, there may not be what's called a strong determination sitting in Native American, but you may find that you're in a sweat pit with a lot of large, full-blooded Indians, and you get in there, and I'm not that big, right? I feel like a proverbial toothpick, just crushed. Well, it's an automatic strong determination sitting. No matter how much I may want to move, there's no way I'm going to be able to move, not with 250 pounds on either side of me. One of the things you're going to discover if you get involved in Native American things is that there's a lot of humor, even though there's a lot of sacrifice. There's a lot of humor. The two go hand in hand. You get all these big guys get into this sweat lodge, and they say like, cheek up, brother. You get it? Cheek to cheek, right? Not these cheeks. Cheek up, brother. It's like you're in there cheek to cheek. Sometimes if it gets hot, they start to go like that, and sometimes they fall over on me. I'm literally crushed by these huge bodies. It's a guaranteed strong determination sitting. There will be no movement of the body, voluntary or otherwise, because you're just in there, and you have to be with what is. It replicates a lot of the things that we do in our Buddhist practice. These are some sort of general considerations. One more general consideration I'd like to make or talk about. Anthropologists talk about two ways to describe a culture. You can either describe the culture from the perspective of your own culture, or you can describe the culture from within the culture itself. They have words. They have a vocabulary in the anthropological literature. They talk about an emic versus an etic approach. It means whether you're describing it from the culture itself or from your own culture. There are two ways that we can describe what happens in these Native American, well, the many ways of course, but I'd like you to consider two ways. One way is from within the context of that culture itself. The other is from the perspective of Buddhism. Buddhism is on the outside looking into the Native American culture. Most Indian ceremonies involve some kind of sacrifice. Now, it may be a sacrifice of having equanimity with discomfort that is physical. It may be a sacrifice of having equanimity with fatigue. It may be a sacrifice of having equanimity with uncertainty. I mentioned last night, you don't know if the ceremony is going to happen. You've traveled three states. You don't know if or when or if there's going to be room for you, okay, and you just hang out. It may be equanimity with that just hanging out. If I were to describe my basic experience in these last eight years of being with Indians, the basic experience is an experience of sitting around. That's the basic experience, sitting around hour after hour, day after day. If you come from the life in the fast lane, you know, Anglo-American overculture, which I do come from, this is quite a sacrifice because you at least want to be given a class. You want to be given some lore, you know. Okay, if I have to sit around, we'll let them explain to me some interesting thing that other people don't know about their culture, but no, you're not allowed to ask questions. In fact, that's one thing, you know, the white people tend to be very impatient. They start asking these Indians, you know, what does this mean and what does that mean? You very quickly run up against a brick wall. That is not what you're supposed to be doing. What you're supposed to be doing is watching, listening, sitting around and have equanimity with the fact that nothing is happening. Okay, nothing special is happening at all. You're just sitting around, people are smoking cigarettes and they're talking and it's like hours and hours and hours and just time is passing. So there's some kind of sacrifice. Maybe it's to dance, what have you. I remember when I was a kid, you know, you used to watch these like Tarzan movies and John Wayne movies and you see these quote primitive people, you know, the Africans, the Indians, and you'd see them portrayed as sort of jerky people, you know, that are hitting these drums and dancing around and, you know, but what they don't tell you in the movie is they've been hitting that drum and dancing around for three days without sleeping. Okay, what kind of person can do that? What kind of consciousness, what kind of concentration power is built? I mean, if you om for 15 minutes, you get a little concentration. Well, how about hitting a bell or a drum for three days? What kind of concentration, what kind of alteration of consciousness is built? So anyway, there's a sacrifice involved. Often. It may be the sacrifice of inconvenience. Ceremonies aren't convenient. Having equanimity with that sacrifice. From the Buddhist perspective, whenever you have discomfort and you bring equanimity, which is an attitude of acceptance and patience, you'll be sitting around the sweat lodge for a couple hours while other people are sweating. Just sit, be in a meditative state, be aware of the expansion and contraction of mind-body. Whenever we bring equanimity to the flow of experience, according to Buddhism, we are purifying experience. So from the Buddhist perspective, the basic reason that the ceremonies work is that they are a powerful context to bring awareness and equanimity to what may be an uncomfortable, a slightly to exceedingly uncomfortable situation. However, that is not the way the Indians look at it. From their perspective, they have a different model. They are asking wakantanka. I'm using the Lakota, the Sioux word. Waka means sacred or holy or mysterious. And tanka means big. W-A-K-A-N-T-A-N-K-A, if you write it out in the Roman alphabet. They're asking wakantanka, the great spirit, God, grandfather, tunkashila, grandfather, unchimaka, grandmother. They're asking that they may live. The magic word is to live. Live and breathe. That they may have a good life for themselves and for all the oyate, for the people. That's why when you go into the sweat lodge, you say, aho, mitakoyasin. Mitakue means relative or relation. Oyasin means all. So it gets shortened. Mitakue oyasin gets shortened into mitakoyasin. And you say, oh, mitakoyasin, to all my relations. When you get done talking to all my relations, you're asking for a good life for you and all your relatives, all of creation and all of your blood relatives, your friends, too. But you can't ask for anything until you give something. It's not right. And you don't own anything, really, except your own feelings, your own body, your body sensations. So you give of your own body in some way by being patient with fatigue or heat or maybe even being cut in some ceremony, physically slightly scarred. You give of your body, the only thing you really own first. And you keep on giving. And that act of giving eventually, hopefully, maybe, if you're humble enough, if you're small enough, will instill pity, compassion from the Great Spirit. And you will have that good life. You will have those blessings. You will have the purification. That's the model from within the Indian culture. So the ceremony is a religious ceremony. It's speaking to the Great Spirit. But each person conceives of wakantanka in their own way. For some people, wakantanka is Mother Earth. For others, it's Tunkashila, Grandfather. For many, wakantanka consists of 16 parts. And there's a whole philosophy about the 16 aspects of the Great Spirit. It's interesting, isn't it, how each culture has its own real significant numbers. The most prevalent number in the American Indian symbolic system is four. Sort of makes sense, doesn't it? If you're living out in nature, right, can you see how things would tend to come in fours for you? Starting with what? Starting with the four seasons and the four directions. Sometimes we speak of six directions if you include Unchimaka, Grandmother Earth, and Tunkashila, the Grandfather Sky. There's also seven directions. The center is a direction. But four makes a lot of sense. Four seasons, four directions. After the people of North America became aware of the larger world, they became aware that basically there are four colors of people, the red, the black, the white, and the yellow. And that then fit perfectly into their system. You'll see the flags there. Different tribes ascribe different colors to different directions, by the way. You're going to get a little difference of opinion. But you get red, white, black, and yellow are for the four directions. Blue for up and green, the earth, for down. That's why when you came you saw the tobacco ties, didn't you? The prayer flags that were hanging from the tree that were of those colors. In any event, since four is the dominant number of this culture, then the Great Spirit must mean four written big, which is four times four, or 16. So the concept of what the Great Spirit is, is allowed to be whatever that individual understands it. So you see the difference in perspective. There's a Buddhist psychological way of looking at why these ceremonies work. But from within the ceremony, they look at it a different way. By the way, your particular understanding of the Great Spirit comes through a practice called the vision quest, which I'll be talking about in a little while. These were some of the general considerations that I wanted to present to you. A sort of general theory of the ceremonies, a general theory of Buddhist psychology, Buddhist meditation, and how that relates, how the Buddhist theory of growth and transformation relates to the Native American one. And I think I've done that. Have I done my job? In a general way. What we're going to do is, in a moment, take a little break, and then I'm going to come back and talk specifically about what we might call representative practices of the Indian. But before I do that, are there any questions just about what I've talked about so far? Feel free. Questions or comments? Yes. I think it's pretty prevalent. But as I mentioned, there is a tendency nowadays for the Lakota style to become almost pan-Indian. Individual tribes certainly keep up their individual traditions. But my knowledge of Native American practices almost exclusively through this generic thing that is now coming up, and in a sense unifying. In generic ceremonies where you have many tribes together, you will always hear that kind of terminology. By the way, one interesting thing about terminology. There is a book, I believe by a man named Powell, although I could be wrong, and I think it's called Sacred Language. It's a linguistic and anthropological study of the special use of the Lakota language in Lakota ceremonies. In other words, there's ordinary spoken Lakota, but then there is a sacred language. It's ordinary Lakota words, but used in a special way that is used in ceremonies. It's a ceremonial sacred language. What has happened is, those idioms in Lakota have been translated into English, and now become, because people don't speak each other's tribal language, so they often will use English. In fact, usually use English in pan-Indian or inter-tribal ceremonies. Now what happens is, there's a special kind of English that has developed that is only in ceremonies. It's a translationese of Lakota or Sioux into English. In these ceremonies, you hear people talk about the two-legged. In Lakota, there's a word, which means a person, a human. In a ceremony, the Lakotas don't use the word person. They call them two-legged. That's Lakota special language. Now that's translated into English, and all the people, including the non-Indians, the Asians, whites, that participate in these ceremonies, we all say the two-legged, the winged, the four-legged. We're actually talking an English translation of a special Lakota language usage. This grandfather, grandmother kind of thing comes from that too. Medicine wheels are found in many of the cultures, I think. Some people use them in the ceremonies, some people don't. I've never heard Fred, he may use it, but I've certainly never heard him talk about it. The circle is, in general, their special symbol. Do you know what's called a changleshka? You'll see it all the time at Indian ceremonies. It's a circle with a cross in it, which stands, of course, for the four directions, for everything. That's called changleshka. Usually, the ceremonies are done in a circular kind of situation, like when you sun dance, the arbor, which is the area exposed to the sun, is circular. When you are in a tipi, it's circular. I think the idea of the wheel being completeness is a pretty universal trait. The group of people that I sweat with, that organization is called Maza Changleshka Oyate. Oyate is a good word to learn. That means the people. Maza means metal, iron, and changleshka is a circle. It's the people of the iron circle, because they originally started out as an outreach program to Indians in prison. They called the prison, the word for prison in Lakota is iron circle. So they said, we're the Maza Changleshka Oyate, we're the people that go into the iron circle. Circle is a big word. Imagine these cultures when encountering the material culture of the white people, they had to come up with words in their own language for these objects. Some of them are quite interesting. I'll just share with you. Another Lakota word that you should learn is wakhan. Wakhan means sacred or holy, W-A-K-H-A-N. You'll notice there's some aspiration though in the K. Wakhan. Yeah, khan. Wakhan is sacred or holy or magic or mysterious. So what happened is, because so many of the white man's material things were mysterious to them, they all got called wakhan or sacred. So for example, they didn't have horses. So what are you going to call a horse? Well, they did have animals that they used as beasts of burden. Do you know what they used to carry things? Dogs. They would burden up the dogs and they would have the dogs either carry in what was called a travois. You've seen them in movies. It's like an A-frame that the dog carried. Well, when they encountered horses, this was like a super dog for them, right? Because it could carry so much more. Well, the word for dog is shunka in Lakota. So they called it shunka wakhan. They call it a sacred dog. And to this day, that's what a horse is called. Shunka wakhan. Did you ever see that movie, A Man Called Horse? Anybody here ever see that movie? How many saw it? Just curious. If you listen to the dialogue in there, when they call him by name, he was named horse. They say shunka wakhan. That is the Lakota word for horse. They didn't have a word for alcohol, so they called it mani wakhan, mystery water. Mani is water. You know, like mani sota, clear water. Remember, the Dakotas originally came from Minnesota. So most of your place names in Minnesota, like Mankato, for example, is maka, that's earth. Makato means green earth. Mankato. There's Mankato and you know the Minnetonka moccasins? That's Minnetonka, great water. Anyway, I didn't mean to get off into this subject. There's a surface level, then there's an intermediate level, and then there's the source itself. The surface level is called nirmanakaya, the body of appearance. The intermediate level is called sambhogakaya, the body of glory. And the actual source of things, the invisible source of time and space is called dharmakaya, the natural body. Okay, good. What I'd like to do now is take five or ten minutes, have a little stretch break and a pit stop, and we'll come back and we'll talk about what happens in the dances, the sun dance, what happens on the vision quest and things like that. Now that you have a general context to put it in, we'll talk about some specific ceremonies. Does anybody have any questions about time periods? It's not usually in the changing time, that's an individual. Some people get very quiet at that time, I usually do, but other people are still convivial. But once we go into the lodge, I mean there'll be humor in there, you know, he'll tell jokes and whatever, but you'll see what the balance is. It's definitely not a hippy-dippy, everybody does what they want to do kind of situation inside a sweat lodge. But on the other hand, it's a feel comfortable, because you're going to be expressing yourself. Mary, where do people change actually? Wherever? Okay. Out and about. There is a way that people do change, because this situation comes up very often, you don't have any particular dressing rooms or whatever. What you do is you wrap the towel around you, and you can take off your clothes sort of inside the towel, and then put on your bathing trunks. It's a whole art, knowing how to do this. Or you find a bush someplace, you go out behind a bush. If you have rings and that kind of stuff, earrings, you want to take that all off. You can ask permission if you can put it on the altar, that's fairly traditional, but do ask permission. People tend to maybe put their glasses on the altar, or you can put your glasses off where they'll be safe. You don't want to have anything like that on you when you go into the lodge. If you want to take a towel with you in the lodge, that's fine, you can use it to sit on or cover you or something like that. Okay, any other questions? Yes. And sitting outside the lodge is a very powerful experience. When I go to my Mazatchangleshko Yate group, a lot of times I don't get in the first lodge, I have to wait until the second lodge. And I like to just touch the lodge, just be near it, because it's just something that comes off of it. I don't think I've ever felt more safe in my life than the first time I went into one of these Lakota sweat lodges. It's just like, okay, now I'm home. It is a kind of womb in there. Let me teach you the words, mi ta ko ya in. Mi means my, actually it's similar to English, coincidentally. And ta ko ya in means all relatives or all relations. So it means all my relations. When you go in, if you can't remember to say, ho mi ta ko ya in, then you just remember the English, all my relations. And whenever you, if you're asked to express yourself, you may be asked to make a prayer, maybe you don't pray, then you can just be silent. And when you're done, you say, mi ta ko ya in, and the next person knows it's his or her turn. So mi ta ko ya in is sort of the Lakota equivalent to amen, in some ways. Well, you say oh or ho in front of it, you know. Oh mi ta ko ya in. Oh mi ta ko ya in. Or ho mi ta ko ya in. Ho mi ta ko ya in. And then the sweat leader may say ho, okay. They really do say that. It's not just in the movies. Ho is the Lakota greeting. It's true. That is authentic. So when you go in, some sweat leaders, when you say ho mi ta ko ya in, then they say ho, you know, because they'll greet you coming in. It's interesting because in Europe they say chao. Chao, yeah. Other words you may hear, in the Lakota language, to make something emphatic, you put lo at the end, l-o. So you may hear people say things like wa shi te lo, that means it's good. See, everything that you do in there will be affirmed. Everything is positive. So whatever you say, people will say that's good, wa shi te lo, like that. You may hear people use the word tonka shila, that means grandfather. You may hear them use the word wakantonka, which is the great spirit. Those are some of the Lakota words you may hear. We'll be singing songs in there. The songs will mostly be Sundance songs. Sundance songs are very powerful because they're songs that are made to keep you going in an incredible physical ordeal. They're songs that replace the need for food, water, and rest. So it's that kind of music. So you'll be hearing some very strong songs in there. They'll mostly be Lakota Sundance songs, but there may be some Kickapoo songs that Fred might sing like that. We'll see what they do. Any other questions? There are different individual styles. In some sweats, you smoke the chanumpa. You know what chanumpa is? That's a pipe. In some sweats, you smoke a chanumpa while you're in the sweat. In other traditions, you smoke the chanumpa after you leave the sweat. I do believe we'll be making a circle afterwards and passing the pipe. Don't be afraid of the pipe. They'll show you how to use it. It's a focusing object in their culture. The bowl is usually red. It's made of a stone called Catlinite, which is quarried in southern Minnesota at the Pipestone National Monument. It's named after where it's quarried. The stone is named after George Catlin, who was an early 19th century artist that left paintings and sketches that portray the Indian culture before it began to be changed by contact with Europeans. In honor of Catlin, who actually, one of his famous paintings shows the native quarrying of stone there in Minnesota. They named the stone Catlinite. It's a very distinctive red color. There's a long stem. The meaning of the pipe will be explained to you. How to hold the pipe will be explained to you. However, this I will say. Draw very strong on the pipe. It's big. It's a very narrow thing. It's a long thing. You don't have to take the smoke into your lungs. In fact, usually you don't. You just take it into your mouth and then you let it out. Sometimes people, I know most of you wouldn't have this idea, but I just have to mention this. People think there's some sort of mind altering substance in a sacred pipe. The use of peyote is a completely separate religion. That's cactus and it's not smoked anyway. It's eaten. What's in the pipe is k'nik-k'nik. K-I-N-I-C-K-K-I-N-I-C-K. K'nik-k'nik. K'nik-k'nik is a mixture of red willow bark, bearberry, tobacco, and other herbs. It is the traditional smoke of the plains India. That's what's in that pipe. Tobacco and actually mostly red willow bark is what you're smoking. There's nothing in there that's not natural or whatever. You need to draw pretty strong on the pipe because if possible you don't want the pipe to go out. If it goes out, okay, it goes out. You try to keep it lit. You'll see there's a whole art of smoking it. You hold the bowl in your left hand and the stem in the right hand. You draw a few times. Their idea is that when you see that smoke, they pray. A very important part of the ceremony is when you load the pipe. You'll be seeing, we'll be doing it out there. They pick up the tobacco and they hold it to the seven directions. The east, the west, the north, the south, above, below, and the center. They take one pinch for each direction and you put it into the pipe. What you're doing is you're gathering the whole universe and all your prayers into that pipe when you're loading it. There's a special song, which is the pipe loading song, which you'll hear us sing, which goes, Kola leche lechonwo, friend do it this way. Hechanuki, if you do it this way, your grandfather, Waniangukdelo, will come down and talk to you. It's a very beautiful pipe loading song. The pipe will be loaded and since everyone's prayers have gone into that tobacco, when it's smoked, you see it come out and go and disperse back into the universe, go up to the Great Spirit. The pipe is a focusing mechanism. It is the center of the Lakota religion. It is to the Lakotas what Jesus is to Christians. It's the thing that allows them to directly communicate with the Great Spirit. It's the intermediary, the thing that makes the connection between the person and the source. It's used that way. They talk about using the tobacco, using it in a good way. It's called a sacred pipe, a chanumpa. It is not called a peace pipe. If you call it a peace pipe, Fred will correct you. But it was used, of course, the reason why people call it that is because if you carried the pipe, you wouldn't be attacked, even if you went through hostile territory. The pipe was held in absolute awe. So that meant you were on a peaceful mission, you might say. So I guess that's why they call it the peace pipe. It's also smoked to make commitment. Anything you say on a pipe within Indian culture, you better be ready to stand by your word. When a person makes a vow to vision quest, they say, it happened in the sweat I was in just last week. When a person makes a vow to vision quest, they're in the sweat lodge and they're holding a pipe with the bowl towards them, stem out like this. And they just hold that pipe for the whole sweat lodge. And they say, I'm going to go up on the hill. And they're asking the sweat leader to put them out on the hill. And they ask and they say, I want you to put me out on the hill. I'm going to go four days, no food, no water, no shelter. I'm going to ask for a vision. And they just hold that pipe. And their mentor, the sweat leader, warns them of the terrible difficulties they'll go through, how hard it is. And he says, think, or she says, think real hard. You still have that pipe in your hand. Think real hard throughout this ceremony, this sweat. Are you ready to do this? Still have the pipe in the hand means when that pipe is placed in the medicine person's hand is transferred, you have made your commitment. As long as you still have it there, you haven't made that commitment. As soon as you've given the pipe to the medicine person, you've made your pledge. And you have to think real hard. Are you ready to do this? When a person makes a vow, a pledge to sun dance, four days, no food, no water, dancing in the height of the summer sun, piercing your own flesh, they do it by giving a pipe. And if they fail on that commitment, it's very, very, very bad. And that's impressed on you very strongly. So the pipe is used in that way. It's a connection to the source. It's a focusing device. But it's also a way of assuring absolute sincerity in interaction. They used to do a lot of things to try to deceive other tribes. But what you said on a pipe better be true. So there'll be a pipe and you'll see it being loaded. It will be up there on the altar. The stem and the bowl are always kept separate until the pipe is used because it's like male and female. And when they come together, there's an empowerment, something special happens. So you keep them separate except at the time of usage. So these are some of the attitudes about the pipe. As I say, don't be afraid of it. You'll be shown how to use it and you'll see how to hold it and what feeling you get from it when you do hold it. Any other questions about what we'll be doing of Sundance songs? The answer is yes and no. What do I mean by that? What I mean is such tapes do exist. There have been tapes made of the sacred songs. There are even books that have it written in Romanized script. And Jim Bond, Indian Traitor has them. So from that perspective, yes. But whether you really want to do that or not, whether that's a good idea, is something to really think about. Because these are not just songs. In their culture, wealth was measured by the number of songs you were empowered to sing. Just like in our culture, wealth is measured by your bank account, how much you have in your bank account. Wealth was measured in their culture by how many songs you're ready to sing. And the way you learn songs is by just listening year after year after year after year and hearing those songs within the context of the ceremony, within the context of your sacrifice. So that when you finally do learn that song, it has a lot of meaning to you. Or the song is revealed to you by the spirits on a vision quest or just comes to you sometime. So yes, any of you could order and get a tape and you could learn those songs. But they might end up being just songs rather than medicine. So I would encourage you not to just go out and do that right away. Because you're just cheating yourself. In essence, what you're doing is it's like taking somebody else's money. So there's a lot of range of how you want to look at these things. A song is a power. I remember the first time I heard Indian singing, I thought to myself, I'll never be able to tell the songs apart. Every one of them sounds exactly the same. They're all exactly the same. I'll never be able to tell the difference between them. I forget about singing them. But you hang out and you listen and you imitate and you listen and you're there in the sweat and you're in high states of concentration and you're maybe suffering or something and you're open and pretty soon you're singing them. It just sort of comes to you. That's the way they should be learned. Also, a song is a ceremony. So you don't just sing a song to anyone because there might be a woman on her moon period or something. You don't sing those songs unless it's within a certain context. So it's a whole way it has to be treated. Indians always talk about using things in a good way. So if you want to learn the songs, do. But learn them in a good way. Use them in a good way. So you be the judge. The answer is yes and no. Yes, you can get tapes. But maybe you don't want to get them. It depends on what you want those songs to mean to you. Here again we have the use of the English language influenced by the use of Indians. Medicine is the entire range. It doesn't just mean medicine for a disease. Medicine is virtually equivalent to wakhan.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.94, "text": " Right.
