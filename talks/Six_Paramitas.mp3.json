{"text": " Today I want to talk about one of the traditional categories of Buddhist training, which is called the Six Paramitas. Some of you may know Buddhists like to divide the path into all sorts of different categories. For example, there's the three-fold training, there's the eight-fold path, there is the ten bodhisattva stages, there's the thirty-seven components of enlightenment, many, many such categories. And it's useful to sort of have those categories in the forefront of one's mind, just to have a very clear idea of what's involved in the training, although sometimes it can get to be a bit much to study so many of them. But one of the very prevalent divisions of the aspects of the path is this six paramitas. It's especially used in the Mahayana tradition, the so-called great vehicle. The word paramita itself is actually rather interesting. It's a Sanskrit word, and as I'm sure many of you are aware, Sanskrit is an Indo-European language, that's to say it's ultimately related to English. It's cognate with English. And the word para, P-A-R-A, is actually related to two English words, the word far and the word for, not the number, but as in foremost. And the ma is a superlative, so parama would mean that which is furthest, but it can also mean sort of foremost. And paramita is a practice that will take you to the furthest place, which is to say the other shore, enlightenment itself. But it's also a thing that you can become foremost in, in other words, something that you can master. So it's an interesting word. These are aspects of practice that are to be mastered. That's why sometimes you'll find the word translated as, quote, perfections. They are things that you can perfect with practice, and they get you to that farthest shore, which is the enlightened state. So there's sort of that double meaning in them. Are you familiar with one of the very standard Buddhist metaphors about the river and the other shore? You may have heard of it if you have read early Buddhist literature. The Buddha said that all of these teachings and all of these techniques, the thing that we now know as Buddhism, are like a raft that you can go from the bank, one bank of a river to the other bank. And the bank of the river that we're at is, or most people are at, is called suffering. Of course, a lot of that suffering is unacknowledged, semi-conscious, subliminal, but it's there and influences us in different ways. And to go from the place of conditional happiness, or, quote, suffering, to unconditional happiness was compared to taking a raft across a river. And so to reach the other shore or that furthest is to reach a state of unconditional freedom, unconditional happiness. The interesting part of the metaphor is that what the Buddha said was that, of course, when you reach the other shore, you don't carry the raft with you. It's just an expedient to get you there. So this is a very famous old metaphor that was used. So enlightenment was referred to as sort of the other side, going to the other side. The six things that get you to the other side, of course, there are many ways that we can divide the pie in terms of the aspects of the practice. But one way is to divide it into these six. And the six are, I'll give you the Sanskrit forms, d\u0101na, \u015b\u012bla, k\u1e63\u0101nti, v\u012brya, dhy\u0101na, and praj\u00f1\u0101. Now, unless you're a scholar of Sanskrit or Buddhist culture, most of those words probably are new to you, but it's sort of good, I think, to learn the words themselves. D\u0101na is the first, and it's actually pretty close to the English word that it's related to. It means giving. Can you tell what Latin word it would be related to? That we have any donation, right, donare, to give. So d\u0101na is giving. And, of course, in the more superficial way, it's giving material things to support the community of practitioners. So, for example, at the end of retreats, traditionally, like the teachers and the cooking staff and whatever are given d\u0101na by the people that have done it. And the d\u0101na is what you live on. The important thing about d\u0101na is that it is a sort of way of letting go of I, me, and mine. The Western concept of contributions that we sometimes see, like where you go into a hospital or a church and it says, this wing was donated by so-and-so, or this pew was donated by so-and-so, actually looks a little bit funny from the perspective of spiritual practice. Because the whole idea in giving something is to let go of the sense of I, me, and mine. So if you sort of are getting credit for it, that militates against the merit. In fact, they speak of the three things that must be empty. When you go out on your begging rounds, I used to live like this when I was in Japan, you live by begging. Now you don't ask directly for anything, you're just there. And you're walking through the streets and people put things in your, they give you d\u0101na, they put things in your bag. In Japan it's a bag, in Southeast Asia you carry a bowl. And they say that the person that gives, the person that receives, and the act of giving must all be empty, in other words, without ego grasping. So when you go on your begging round and people give you this d\u0101na, it's very interesting, you wear a hat that covers your head and covers your face. Have you ever seen this in Japanese movies? You may have seen it. It's a very distinctive one. In fact, I've got it up in my apartment. I saved it from all those years ago. And you walk down the street and your hands are like this, your eyes are down, and you just walk very, very slowly, and you chant, OM Like that, over and over and over as you're walking. H\u014d in Japanese means dharma, the spiritual path. So you're sort of manifesting the dharma by your presence. So you're giving the dharma by your vibe, by the way you walk, by that whole symbolic value. And that's called dharmad\u0101na, the gift of the dharma. It can be through preaching, it can be through just your presence. And then the people give you material d\u0101na, they put it in your bag. But they don't see your face. You don't talk to them, you don't ask for anything. And there's no thanking or anything like that, but it's done very, very elegantly, because as you're walking you have your hands like this, and then if somebody wants to give you d\u0101na, they stand with their hands like this, and you just see them sort of off in the distance. And you go up and you take the edge of your bag, and you just sort of hold the edge of your bag like this, and they put money right on the edge. And then as you bow and bring your hands up like this, the money just slips right in. You never have to touch the filthy lucre with your hands. It's done so elegantly, you just sort of end with a bow like that, but you don't look, you don't say anything. Sometimes they say things to you, though, it can be very interesting. It can be very inspiring for your practice. I remember once in Kyoto I was walking like that on the d\u0101na rounds, and somebody came up and they said, I'm very busy with my household duties and whatever, and I can't meditate, I don't have time to practice, but please you get enlightenment for me. And it was just like an old man, and it was very, very sincere, and it's just like things like that happen. So it's a very interesting system in early Buddhism, that sort of the double d\u0101na, you give the dharma d\u0101na, and then they take care of you materially. And then the way you go to collect it, I think you can imagine after two hours of walking with your eyes down, and just going like that, you get a pretty good meditative state going. So it's like everybody benefits. They give you trivial amounts of money, just a hundred yen. Well, in my day it was a hundred yen, I don't know what it is now. It's small amounts, and then you give the dharma and you get to meditate at the same time. So this d\u0101na is a practice that everybody can do. But the really important thing is not how much you give, but that sort of idea of the letting go of something of oneself, the sense of I, me, and mine. So that's the first of these practices, that if we take it on, it's something we can get better and better at it. We can learn how to be more and more and more releasing as we give our support. And also it forms one of the bases that takes us over to that other shore of enlightenment. The second of the paramitas is called \u015b\u012bla in Sanskrit, or sila in Pali. Many of you do know what this word is. It's usually translated as morality, but it is much more like character. Yes, it refers to things like not stealing, not killing, not lying, not taking life, which sort of form the basis upon which one can practice. If one has an undisciplined daily life, it's difficult to really achieve the meditative states. So this \u015b\u012bla is sort of the habit of self-discipline. And again, it's something that can be developed with practice. It's something that one gradually masters, and one falls away from it, and then starts practicing again, and falls away, and starts practicing again many, many times, because it's not an absolute moral code. It is an area to be perfected, to be mastered, in that sense, a paramita. This \u015b\u012bla paramita is very important, because as one goes deeper in the path, one will come to states of liberation from the mind-body process. Now, that means liberation from the aspect of the mind, which is called in the West the super-ego or the conscience. We really do become free. We really do break the identification with the entire mind-body process. In doing so, though, we have to be very careful, because we want to be free from what is called the conscience, or guilt, or the super-ego. But at the same time, we need to be very compassionate moral beings. This is a tricky thing. So at the beginning of one's practice, and in fact throughout one's practice, if one continues to sort of carve the grooves of wholesome habits, the \u015b\u012bla, then when one reaches a point where there's no longer any internal punisher of conscience, one still will be behaving just by the momentum of one's \u015b\u012bla. One will be behaving in wholesome ways. This may be a little far out for some of you, but it becomes very relevant as one goes deeper into the practice. Most people are sort of kept in line out of fear, by fear of their own conscience or by fear of the reproach of others. Now, we become free of that, or we begin to become free of that. Something has to keep us in line. What keeps you in line is momentum. You all know what momentum is. When you're no longer afraid of doing wrong, you still won't do wrong, if you've really sort of cultivated the \u015b\u012bla. So that's an important balancing aspect of this path. D\u0101na, \u015b\u012bla. So the giving, the supporting of other people, and the development of self-discipline. Then, k\u1e63\u0101nti. K\u1e63\u0101nti means patience, and it's a very useful practice indeed. However, it's really important, I feel, to understand the difference between patience and biting the bullet. Okay. If I were to ask you, what is the difference between patience and suppressing and sort of white-knuckling endurance? Well, how would you answer? Acceptance. Acceptance, okay. Patience has an aspect. Yes. Patience has the element of acceptance, of giving into it, as opposed to opposing it. Okay, good. Other things I like? Yes. Openness. Openness, excellent. Accepting your anger and all the negative feelings that come to you, and acknowledging that they are there. So there's an acknowledging aspect. Right. Actually, indeed, the word, now that you mention it, k\u1e63\u0101nti is very interesting. In Sanskrit, it means both patience and acknowledging at the same time. And one of the words that they used was anupatika dharmak\u1e63\u0101nti, the sort of spiritual acceptance that comes by realizing or acknowledging that nothing ever arises. It's a very interesting phrase, meaning both acknowledging and accepting, or enlightened and accepting. I would say there is a contentment, yes. Patience, okay, first of all, I think it's really useful to distinguish between the concept of accepting situations and the concept of accepting the way situations make us feel. Because it's not always appropriate to accept or be patient with situations. There are some situations that we should start pushing and pulling on and changing and shouldn't accept. But when we encounter a situation, it is the purpose of our six senses, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, feeling, and the thinking sense, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, the six senses, that the purpose of these six senses is to register the reality of that situation. Let's say, for example, that we're in the room and the room's too hot. Okay, so the skin registers the heat, the mind registers the fact that the room is hot. The room being hot is one thing, the perception is a response to that. And then we can go and turn on the air conditioner to change the original condition. But how about in between the time you first feel heat to the time it takes for the room to cool down? Okay, there's an uncomfortable situation which is giving rise to uncomfortable sensations. The idea is not to push and pull on those sensations, which are completely an internal thing. If it's appropriate, you can push and pull on the thermostat or push and pull on whatever circumstance you happen to be encountering in life. If it's appropriate, you can push and pull on another person. I want this person to be this way, I don't want them to be that way. If that seems appropriate, yes, we can push and pull on the world. But what happens is that in very, very incredibly invisible, microscopic ways, the instant any one of these six senses, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind starts to register or detect a situation, in incredibly tiny ways, we start to push and pull on the six senses. Okay, that's a sort of internal pushing and pulling. The purpose of the six senses is to passively register reality like a mirror. The purpose of our acting and talking is to not be passive, but to push and pull on the world. But there's a fundamental and very subtle flaw in our engineering, I believe, whereby a little bit of that tendency to exercise the will, which is that tendency to exercise the will is sometimes appropriate with respect to situations, to external actions. But what happens is that the will starts to seep in to the input gate, the receptors. And somebody starts to say something you disagree with, and you start to push and pull on the ear. No, the ear doesn't want to hear that. It tightens up. The body tightens up. The mind solidifies. It doesn't just allow that person to manifest passively in consciousness. So if somebody's in front of you and they're saying something you disagree with, do you just reflect that like a mirror as they're speaking? Or does the whole body congeal? Okay, the my body process congeals. So what's happening is one is pushing and pulling on the perceptual process. Now, the idea would be to not push and pull on the perceptual process, because that's just supposed to be like a mirror. They manifest themselves, and they make you feel in certain ways, and all of that goes through. Then when it's your time to talk, push and pull. If you think you should disagree, what have you, one can take an active role. So I think what patience is, or in understanding patience in a healthy way, it's helpful to realize that all that a person is being passive or surrendering to is the way situations manifest in consciousness, the way they make you feel. One should be, if at all possible, completely passive on the inside, but that does not for a moment imply that a person would be passive on the outside, sometimes passive, sometimes not, depending on the needs of the situation. Patience is simply radical permission to feel what every situation is like without even the tiniest resistance. So that would be all those aspects of acknowledging and what have you. So one need not fear that because one is patient, one is therefore going to be impotent in the world. However, we do fear that, don't we? Do you? I do. Everybody does. At various levels of our being, we are afraid to just relax and open up, because there's a fundamental fear. It's not just at the surface of the mind, but at each level of the mind there is a fear or association, if I let this person make me feel this way, then I'm going to be helpless and vulnerable to this person. And that is a many-level thing. So I would say about half the questions people ask me about practice all boil down to one question, which is the question of, if I meditate on this, then how will I be able to respond? That question comes up in myriad forms. If I'm meditating, what am I going to do about my life then? What am I going to do about this situation? As if to imply that acceptance somehow leads to inaction. Acceptance is an internal thing. It's something you can be doing constantly. You can be completely accepting the way a person makes you feel and arguing vehemently with them at the same time. Does that make sense? If it doesn't make sense, that's okay too, because that just means you've hit one of those levels. Because even though the people said it makes sense, tomorrow they'll hit some level where suddenly it won't make sense. Ultimately it's a kind of serenity then. Because we've all known people that can be serene and cool in the midst of chaos and very strong. Yes, that's right. In fact, the whole idea is, if a person is internally surrendered, if they're not pushing and pulling... Let me make it more tangible. I turn on the television and I listen to, I won't name them, but certain politicians that are in power in this country. How does it make me feel? It makes me feel angry. It makes me feel frightened. It makes me feel humiliated that these people are running my country and doing the things they do. That's the way it makes me feel. Now, those are states of mind and body. And I can guarantee that I can induce those states of mind and body by simply turning on the television any time. And it's very real for me. I'm very frightened. Very frightened. A fear arises. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Now, I would also not like to have to suffer because of fear, because of humiliation, and because of anger. I'd like not to have to suffer. Therefore, I turn on the television, I hear somebody speak who I radically disagree with, and three flavors of sensation fill my body. Rage, humiliation, a humiliated, impotent feeling, and fear. Each of those flavors of sensation is quite distinct, like different flavors of wine. And they arise in certain locations at certain times. They move around in certain ways. So it's my job not to push and pull on those sensations. Not in the slightest. Not to resist them in the teeniest little way, because I don't want to suffer. So I try to be patient internally with that, because if there's any push and pull on that, then it will solidify into a problem. So I'm completely passive on the inside as I listen to these people talk. I feel like a thousand daggers going into me, but if I really do it right, those daggers are just cutting the spring breeze. They're just cutting the air. So it's no problem. That's internal passivity, but that does not mean for a minute that I wouldn't get into a very strong position if I could argue with that person, or if I argue with somebody that upholds that person's position. I would try to be completely surrendering, patient, patient, patient on the inside, just open and dying on the inside. When I'm doing that, if I can do it properly, I'm not wasting any energy fighting with myself. Right? If a person makes you feel a certain way, and it's uncomfortable, and you tense up against the spread of that feeling through the body, who are you fighting with? That person or yourself? Fighting with yourself. When a person fights with themselves, that is internal friction. It's the effect of friction on the functioning of your car. Okay? It dissipates energy and heat, which uses unnecessary fuel. It leads to inefficiency. If I need to fight with somebody, and even the teeniest way I'm fighting with myself, I'm wasting energy that I could be using for a vigorous response. This is what you were saying about a person could be serene but also effective. And what people don't quite realize is how proportionally significant that internal friction is, vis-a-vis their energy pool. In other words, it's not just a little bit of one's psychological energy that is used up by this internal friction. It's a very significant proportion. So, for me, the patience is a thing that has to be clarified, because we're afraid of it. We think we're just going to become passive, helpless people. We are going to become passive, but hopefully not helpless. Passive internally. You know how the Japanese swords were made? It was a unique technology that was only developed in Japan, the samurai swords. They'd take the iron, they'd heat it, and they'd fold it in two. Then they'd bang it down, they'd fold it in two again. They'd bang it down and fold it in two again. Of course, by the time you've done that five times, you have 32 layers. By the time you've done it 10 times, you have over 1,000 layers. And what that would do, that constant heating and folding, heating and folding, heating and folding, would cause a change in the actual structure of the metal, whereby the softer crystals would migrate to the inside, and the harder crystals of steel would migrate to the outside. So that when they made it into a sword, it had the properties of taking- you could sharpen it like a razor, but its internal structure was somewhat rubbery. And that was like a totally unique technology. So it combined the properties of rubber and glass at the same time. It could cut like glass, but it would bend, so it wouldn't snap. And that's what made them so extraordinary, the most extraordinary swords that have ever been produced on the planet. Interesting, just a little cultural aside, often when the swords were made, the person that made the sword was a Shinto priest. And they would fast and sit under waterfalls in winter for days and days and days, until they became possessed by the Shinto gods, and then they would have the gods forge the swords for them. So they had this incredible technology of the iron, but they also linked it up with their spiritual traditions. I mean, how many swords are made by gods, right? I mean, literally, it was done in a transmedium state. Anyway, those qualities of being utterly soft on the inside, soft as whipping cream on the inside, but potentially sharp on the outside, is what in fact characterizes the Japanese Zen masters. Enough about patience. The fourth of the paramitas is called virya. You may be able to guess. It means energy or vitality. Can you guess the English word it's related to? Viral. Viral, that's correct. That's right. It's also related to the obsolete Anglo-Saxon word wir, meaning a person or a man, W-I-R, as in werewolf, man-wolf, human-wolf. So virya is sort of energy. Of course, the ultimate source of energy is when you can contact the flow of nature within. There's a sort of effortless effervescence that is the bounciness of emptiness. It may seem like a very peculiar juxtaposition of words to call emptiness bouncy, but it is to physicists too. Empty space to a physicist is like rubber. It just stretches. The so-called gravitational fields and whatever are actually just the stretching of this rubbery thing called space. Likewise to the meditator, there is a sort of effortless bounciness that's in the core of one's being that one can come in contact with. Now, that's the real, we might call the real vitality of practice. But until one contacts that vitality of practice, one has to sort of do it as an act of will, you might say. And you all know what this means. It means when you start to, you sit down and you're focusing on the breath, the mind wanders. You have to bring it back. It wanders again. You bring it back again. It wanders again. You bring it back again. You start to get tired, but you have to sort of push yourself a little bit. That's the virya aspect, the aspect of enthusiasm, strength, vitality, and what have you. You know, it's what keeps you coming back for retreats. It's what keeps you, you sort of need to keep yourself motivated in the practice. Also, it's what keeps you from getting too sleepy. If you get unbalanced in meditation, some people sort of mistake, they mistake semi-sleep states for meditative states. If you just sort of close your eyes and sort of lean up against the wall and buzz a mantra or something, you may go into a meditation state, but you may go into a sinking state. And the virya or vitality aspect is what keeps, is what straightens your spine and opens your eyes and keeps you in the enthusiasm of the practice. So I guess that's where they get some of these metaphors like spiritual warrior and things like that. Okay, let's see. Dhana, shila, kshanti, virya. Number five is dhyana, d-h-y-a-n-a. You can hear the difference between the word dhyana and the word dhyana, can't you? They're completely different. One is aspirated and palatalized. Dhyana refers to concentration, and of course one of the major reasons for sitting is that the mind becomes calm and concentrated. In Pali, the word is pronounced dhyana, j-h-a-n-a. And it basically refers to that whole aspect which is developing the focusing powers of the mind. And if Asia has any contribution to make to the culture of the world, it is probably, if one had to just point out one thing, one thing and only one thing, that is of global significance that Asia has contributed, it is the discovery that concentration power can be cultivated and exercised the same way a muscle can be exercised, and it can be strengthened by systematic work. How important is concentration power and focus? This is a complete trick question. I always start every beginning meditation class or lecture that I give for the general public with this trick question, okay? Like, is it important to be focused or how important is it to be focused? Why is it a trick question? Because it's the most important conceivable thing, isn't it? Can you think of any human activity, any other human activity, that is not in some way enhanced if you have the activity of focus power? So it is the most universal of all conceivable skills. And yet it's the one skill that is very seldom taught. We teach people all these other knowledges and skills and never teach them the thing that will allow them to attain those knowledges and skills more efficiently. So the optimizing thing for all other processes is never taught. Not only is it never taught, it's not even conceived of as something that's available. So people just go about trying to do this, trying to do that, without taking the time to develop special states of focus. Those states of focus become habitual. And as I say, the contribution of Asia is that they discovered that it could be developed, that it could be increased many hundred percent, and they found rather straightforward ways to do it, involving posture, breath, and focusing exercises. So dhyana is this. Dhyana is therefore roughly equivalent to the word samadhi, a word that you may have heard more often. And the two are often linked together, and so one speaks of dhyana samadhi as sort of a single entity. Just, however, for your sort of background, in the Buddhist tradition, dhyana tends to refer to the deeper states of concentration, where one is sort of floating above the world of desires. So there are many, many states of concentration that are lighter than that and very important, and one works at all those different levels. But usually dhyana refers to the rather deeper levels. Any of you know what the Yoga Sutras are? How many of you have ever heard of the Yoga Sutras? The Yoga Sutras are the ancient Hindu text on the science of Raja Yoga, or the royal yoga. The last three steps of yoga... See, one starts out with postures and things like that, breathing exercises, but the yoga path is supposed to culminate in the last three steps being dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. So here we have both dhyana and samadhi being used in a Hindu context. In yoga, they distinguish three levels of concentration. Dhyana is one we're all familiar with, the mind wanders, you bring it back. It wanders again, you bring it back. It wanders again, you bring it back. At least you're bringing it back. That's the state of concentration called dhyana. In the yoga tradition, dhyana meant you don't have to work to bring it back anymore. It just stays there. And the metaphor that's given is that it's like oil pouring, like a stream of sesame oil. You know, it doesn't break. There's no effort needed. There's just an unbroken concentration. It doesn't wander at all. That was dhyana in the yogic tradition. And then samadhi, you might wonder, what's beyond dhyana? Your mind doesn't wander at all. That sounds pretty good. It's just pouring, pouring, pouring, pouring. What's beyond that? Well, in the yogic tradition, samadhi is when it's not just that the awareness is fully focused, but that you merge with the object and the seer, the seen, and the seeing become a single activity. That was called samadhi in the yogic tradition. So the words are used a little bit differently in Buddhism and in the Hindu tradition, but you see the basic vocabulary. It's a little confusing, actually. If you want to do comparative studies, you have to see how the same words are used in slightly different ways in the different Indic spiritual traditions. But in any event, dhyana is the states of concentration, of which there are many, of course. Interestingly, Buddhism came into China about the beginning of the Christian era, and it represented a foreign Kuki cult. As far as the Chinese were concerned, it was a barbarian religion. It took centuries and centuries and centuries for it to become nativized to China, to where the Chinese really felt comfortable with it and sort of made it into their own thing. One of the most important ways that that came about was in the early Tang dynasty, there was a group of people that were very heavily into sitting, did very heavy sitting practice, and therefore started to attain states of enlightenment comparable to that of the Buddha himself. Having developed those depths of enlightenment, they felt confident to start to change Buddhism and express it in their own real Chinese ways, ways very differently from the way Buddhism was expressed in India. For example, in India, Buddhist monks never worked, but the Chinese culture values labor. So they started to show that, well, labor, working, could be an expression. They started to run the rituals of their temples to follow Confucian forms rather than Hindu, Indic forms. They started to draw very heavily from Taoist. There was a whole tradition in Taoism of sort of enlightened conversations. They were called Qingtan, where people would talk back and forth from a very liberated perspective, until one of them fell into ego and was defeated. As soon as you're trying to win, you've lost. It's very interesting. This was done in the Taoist tradition. They adopted all of this stuff, and the reason that they did it, that they really started to push and pull on the Buddhist tradition and reform it, was that they were heavy-duty sitters, and they had the confidence that comes from that experience. So people started to call them, oh, those are the sitters. And the word that was used for sort of heavy-duty meditation or sitting meditation, since they didn't have a good term in Chinese, they had transliterated the Sanskrit word dhyana into Chinese as chana. And then, as the Chinese usually do, they abbreviated it as chan. And they said, that group of meditators, they said, well, those are the sitters. Those are the chan, the sitters. And it went from being a common noun to being sitters with a capital S, and got to be the name of a school of Buddhism, which, as you know, probably, in Japanese, is pronounced zen. So the zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese character chan. The Chinese character chan is a transliteration of the Sanskrit word dhyana or jhana, meaning sitting. And originally, it just meant any sitting, and then it meant, quote, the sitters, okay, the ones that do a lot of sitting, but also the ones that were getting the experiences, and therefore the ones that didn't hesitate to re-express those things in terms of their own culture. So dhyana is actually the origin of the word zen. Okay, as one is developing these states of concentration, they become the tools for achieving the final of the six paramitas, which is called prajna paramita. And that is insight, or often translated as wisdom. But unfortunately, when we say wisdom, we sort of think of fortune cookies and stuff like that, right? You know, this is the wisdom that comes from direct experience, from understanding one's own process. And prajna, for people that meditate, especially that have meditated many years, of course, is sort of the sumum bonum, the ultimate good that this all leads to. It's very, very interesting, but the prajna aspect, or wisdom aspect, can be a little confusing to people when they first start to study, especially when they start to intellectually study. It's very confusing to me. Because this wisdom, or insight, is like a many-faceted jewel. It's a jewel that you can look at from all different sides. It's the same jewel. But the sides are different. And at different times, a person that has this wisdom will tend to emphasize one side or another. And at different times in their career, so when you get your first enlightenment experience, your first insight experience, you're likely to say, ah, yes, now I understand. Wisdom is that there's no ego, there's no abiding self. And then a few months pass or a few years pass, and you say, well, yes, that was true, but now I really understand what this wisdom is. The real wisdom is emptiness. Not only is there no self, there's no world either. And then you go a little further, so you're saying it's emptiness. And then maybe a couple more years pass, and you realize, well, wait, this wisdom, what this really is about is that it's how emptiness gives rise to appearance. That's what wisdom is. It's not just that it's empty, it's dynamic. The process whereby nothing gives rise to something. That's what wisdom is. And then you go a little further, and it's like, but yet it really is empty, so maybe we should just call it emptiness. And then a few years pass, and maybe we should call it God. A few more years pass, gee, maybe we'd call it the true self. You start out, is it no self, is it true self, is it God, is it emptiness? It gets very confusing to people. Is it suchness, or is it being without characteristics? These are all facets of that wisdom, and it is an unfolding. How does one achieve this unfolding of wisdom? Oh, by the way, I've given you etymologies. Prajna, P-R-A-J-N with a tilde, that's the Nya, A. Prajna is, the root is Jna, which is indeed related to the Greek word gnosis, and is also related to the old English word to know, which we now pronounce no, right, K-N-O-W. That's the Jna, or the Gna in Sanskrit. In fact, in modern North India, it would be pronounced Prajna, Gna, Gna really sounds like gnosis, doesn't it? The Pra is the same as the Pro, it means fourth, so it's a knowing fourth. Actually, it's a direct cognate of the Greek word prognosis, to know fourth, literally. But in this case, it means not to know what's going to happen, but to sort of know in a very intense and penetrating way. It's a fourth knowing. The way one comes to the Prajna is by using the Dhyana, or concentration, as a microscope to observe the mind-body process. I just said the way, that was incorrect, that is a way. There are a number of ways that the concentration power can be used in order to come to the experience of this transformation of consciousness, this Prajna. And in fact, on numerous Sunday mornings, I have talked about those different ways. The one that you usually hear me talk about, perhaps ad nauseum, is the Vipassana way, where you use the concentration power like a microscope to observe the infrastructure of thought and feeling. In other words, when you deal with anatomy, there's sort of gross anatomy, it's like the organ systems. You can do gross anatomy with the naked eye. If you want to get down to the cellular level, the universal building block of life, then you need a microscope to study that. In the same way, we can talk about personalities, we can talk about individuals and why I'm this way, because my mother was this way, my father was that way, I had this and that influence on me. This is to deal with the individual at the level of gross anatomy. Very important, okay, gross anatomy is certainly to be studied. But that's naked eye knowledge of who you are. When you start using concentration or focus as a microscope, an awareness magnifying device, then you can start to look at the infrastructure or the fine building block, the building block of all consciousness, not only my personality, but your personality, not only the human personality, but the animals, all consciousness, is built out of the same fundamental stuff. Just like all life is on a physical level built out of the same fundamental cells. By observing very, very carefully just what is, one penetrates down into the ultimate constituent of experience. And one day one calls it emptiness, the other day one calls it God, the next day one calls it the true self, the next day one calls it the flow of nature. You'll call it different things at different times. You're quite free to look at it from any of those perspectives as long as you are in fact looking at the actual thing. But very difficult to see the cells of a person's body just by looking with your eye. They're there, but their significance is not evident. So one needs the dhyana, one needs that concentration power in order to discover the perfection that is present in each moment of consciousness. As I scratch my nose here, the whole universe should be vibrating, should be scintillating with like a thrill of cosmic joy. Now that may seem a little hyperbolic in the use of language, but it's true. They say that you haven't made love unless the earth shakes. That's true of everything, you haven't heard the bell unless the earth shakes. You haven't seen a tree unless the earth shakes. To be able to see that going on moment by moment is prajna. Prajna is a kind of transformation of consciousness. After it starts to develop within a person, as you're sitting there meditating and when you start meditating and you say, gee, I wish my mind would just shut up and stop turning and why I'm going through all these stray thoughts. After prajna starts to arise within a person, as you sit there, your stray thoughts, what would have been just stray thoughts and nonsense, the mind's random turnings turn into spiritual insights. It's very interesting. It is an actual altered state of consciousness. That's why it's sometimes referred to as intuitive wisdom. And in the Zen tradition, they cause prajna to arise within you by forcing you to answer problems that you cannot answer with rational thought. Actually, it's what they call ashvara paravrtti. It's like a complete turning at the base of the mind, whereby from that time on, insight just happens. It just percolates up in cascades. That's prajna. Okay, my actual topic for today was how these six paramitas are cultivated in sitting, the act of sitting meditation. Now, if you've listened to what I said, I think you can immediately see how the sitting practice would be, not to mix metaphors, but it would be the very avatar of these six paramitas, the very personification of it. Dana, giving. You sit there. Don't you have to give up something? Don't you have to give of yourself to do that? And in fact, ultimately, don't you give the ultimate gift as you're sitting? You merge with the room. It's a total giving of self, the giving of your time. Sila, self-discipline. Yes, there's going to be times you don't feel like sitting. You have to sort of discipline yourself, make those grooves, the habit patterns. Shanti, patience. That's very evident, especially towards the end of the sitting as you're waiting for the bell, how patience is being cultivated. Virya, yes, you've noticed that you tend to sort of slump like that. You have to revitalize yourself. You slump, you revitalize yourself. Concentration power, dhyana, obviously. That, in fact, is the main reason for becoming so still. And prajna wisdom, yes, because in order to be able to really, at least at first, in order to be able to see the mind-body process with clarity, we have to stop it down. We have to slow it down and actually bring it to a death-like stillness, because any little jarring will obscure our ability to perceive the subtle infrastructure of consciousness. So the sitting leads to wisdom because of the stillness and the lack of distracting things we can go within and get these insights. So the motionlessness, it's very important to be completely without motion as much as possible when you sit, because that then becomes the laboratory, that special environment wherein one can explore consciousness. So this is how the sitting practice brings about the cultivation of all of the six of these aspects which we can master and which bring us to that other shore. How far away is the other shore? That's what a Zen person would say. How far away is the other shore? Because whenever you talk about other shore, you're deluding people, but what are you going to do? It's difficult to communicate these things without deluding people. You may remember a few weeks ago I talked about the Buddhism of Tibet and how in Tibetan Buddhism there is an enormously elaborate symbolism and how the form of Hindu rituals is used as a vehicle for cultivating the Buddhist path. And when I talked about that, I divided the path into four. Today I divided the path into six. I just wanted to share one last thing with you, apropos of the iconography and the symbolism used in Tibetan Buddhism relative to these six paramitas. If you look at the altar, and this is also true in the Japanese Shingon tradition, if you look at a Shingon altar, you will see different kinds of offerings there. Each one of those offerings stands for one of the paramitas. And people that know this and know the cultural background, when they see the altar, it has a big impact on the subconscious mind because it's sort of a message. One way to reach the deep mind is through the body sensations. The other way to reach the deep mind is through symbolism. So if you know the symbolism of Buddhist altars, it can be sort of nice. And it's based on the six paramitas. There's a little container that has water. That stands for dana or giving because however poor you may be, you can certainly have some water that you can give to a guest. So that's like the common denominator of giving. It's not what you give but the idea, and everybody can at least give water. And it was the custom to always give water to guests when they came to your house in India. So that stood for dana. Shila is the anguent. Anguent is like perfume, yeah, and that's held in another container. And you put that on your body, and of course the idea being that a wholesome character gives this nice fragrance to your being. There's nothing offensive in you. Oh, you even have the phrase in English, you smell good, meaning that you're morally okay. Kshanti or patience is symbolized by the flowers. I like that symbol. That appealed to me a lot when I was suffering in practice, alone, cold in Japan. The flowers, of course. Patience is a state that is utterly soft and delicate like the flower. Virya or energy is the stick incense, the jaw stick. It burns hot, but you also notice it burns even. It's not a matter of like having spurts of energy and then leaving off, and spurts of energy and leaving off. It's the evenness of the intensity, and that's symbolized by the stick incense. The food offerings, which may take the form of fruit, or often they take the form of rice, stand for dhyana, or the deep, concentrative states. Now that may seem like rather strange. You may wonder what's the connection between the deep, concentrative states and food offering. But think about it. Think about the physiological impact as you go into those meditative states. It impacts on your metabolism. You don't need to eat as much. You don't need to sleep as much. You don't need to breathe as much. In fact, you more or less feel like the samadhi or the dhyana is supporting and nurturing you on a physical level. Those of you that have gone into intensive practice know exactly what I'm talking about. It's food. It's literally a nutrient. It's a food that can sustain you, just like air and all those other things. If you get a diminishing of your need, then that's a nurturing. So dhyana is symbolized by the food. And finally, the lamps or the candles symbolize the prajna, which is an obvious meaning of the light or the clarity that comes.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "
