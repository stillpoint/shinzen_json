{"text": " This path has a number of complementary facets to it. So, sometimes it can be a little confusing because we can't say it's just this way or just this way. But what we can do is give you the range of facets. And you can understand, based on that, where your experiences lie and some of the possibilities for working with experience. I like to think about these facets as being complementary rather than contradictory. Here are some of the complementary pairs. On one hand, this is a path of refining our personal life. In other words, learning how to be a good person interacting with other people. The complementary facet that goes with that is that this path is about transcending our personal life. Experiencing a state, at least upon occasion and for certain durations of time, where the ordinary identification with the sense of personal identity is actually broken. And to understand that the refining of the personal self and the standing outside of the personal self actually complement each other. The better you are at one, the better you get at the other is one of the hallmarks of spiritual maturity. If you can stand outside of the identification with the talk, image and feel that moment by moment produce the sense, I am, I perceive, I act, I will, I exist, then that gives you what Archimedes called the pusto in Greek, a place to stand. He said, give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the world. To bring about significant changes in how we are as a human being seems as weighty a task as moving the world, doesn't it? We need a lever and a place to stand. The lever is mindfulness. It's a tool that allows us to redistribute the task of self-transformation into something that is doable with ordinary human force. And the place to stand, that's the equanimity, that's the fulcrum. From that objective witness perspective, we can lift ourselves up by our own bootstraps, so to speak. Conversely, the more we get the specifics of our life together in the mundane sense, in the personal sense, the easier it's going to be to do formal practice. In early Buddhism, the aspect of practice which is the refining of the personal self is called sila, which is sometimes translated as precepts or morality, but actually in Pali the word means character. And then the aspects of transcending the personal self are samadhi and panya. Samadhi is concentration. Panya is wisdom, insight. So this is one pair. And these are two jobs and they're both very big and they're both very important. Another pair of complements on this path is that on one hand this path is something we do for ourselves so that we can be happy, independent of conditions and circumstances. A phrase easy to say, but truly awesome in its implications. Think about it. Happiness independent of circumstances. Think of how dependent on circumstances the ordinary concept of happiness is. Nothing wrong with happiness dependent on circumstances, but if that's our only concept of happiness and our only way to be happy, then what are we setting ourselves up for? We're setting ourselves up for abject suffering, at least upon occasion. So on one hand this path is something we do for ourselves. We work on ourselves for ourselves so as to reduce physical and emotional suffering, to elevate physical and emotional fulfillment in our life. That's quite legitimate. On the other hand this path is something that we don't do for ourselves, but rather that we do so that we can better serve our fellow beings. And there's an interplay between those two facets also. The more we become unconditionally happy, the easier it is to reach out to others. Conversely, the more we reach out to others and serve, the easier it is to sit. What we do when we sit, there are some complementary pairs there too. On one hand there is an aspect certainly of doing something simple that sort of calms and develops some focus and concentration. And of course most people conceive of meditation in those terms. And that is an important part of the practice. What are simple things that develop calm and concentration? Well, focus on the breath, mantra, maybe a simple visualization. Some people that have eidetic imagery that are very artistically inclined can rather easily create an image of a full moon or a field of light or something like that. Very simple object and then focus on that and develop a lot of calm and concentration. So a simple visualization, a mantra, focusing on the breath, maybe focusing on a movement can develop a lot of calm and concentration. And that's an important facet. And this may be a time for you to do that. On the other hand, there's the complementary facet, the aspect of meditation that involves clarification. When we do the aspect that involves clarification, sometimes it's not so calming. It may bring stuff up, number one. And number two, the act of attempting to clarify may require a lot of effort and may also require us to think more than we would like to think. In general, when you acquire a new skill, for example, when you learn my favorite metaphor that most of you have heard, when you learn to drive the car, you have to think a lot and you have to effort a lot initially. But at some point, you don't have to think a lot or effort a lot in order to drive the car. You just internalize that skill. And in fact, at some point, it's so internalized, you've all had this experience of you're in the car and you suddenly realize for the last ten minutes you ain't been in the car. Who drove the car? For those of you who didn't crash, somebody was driving the car, but it wasn't you. You ever had that experience? Suddenly realizing to your horror that you haven't actually been driving this car? You've been so in la-la land? Well, who drives the car? In a sense, we can say all your years of habit of driving the car drove the car. At some point, the skills of clarification of our experience become so ingrained that it's like that. It doesn't take a meditating ego, efforting and thinking about it in order to keep track of all of the components and subcomponents with full specificity. But it takes longer to learn how to do that than it does to drive the car on automatic pilot. On the other hand, you drive the car, you get a sort of freedom. Remember? I certainly do. Wow! This sure beats having to take the bus or snore a ride from somebody or walk. You get... Wow! It really enhances the scope of your life when you learn how to drive the car. Well, when you learn how to keep track of talk, image and feel on automatic pilot, that enhances your freedom a million times more than the freedom that you get when you learn how to drive the car. So even if it's ten times harder, if it gives you a million times more freedom, I call that a good investment. But you need to decide what the mixture of efforting in order to clarify versus doing the more simple, calming type practice. At a given time in a person's development, one might be more appropriate than the other. Mostly, I'll be talking about the clarifying aspects of the practice. But that's just what I'll be talking about. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's what you got to be doing. You might want to do one of the simpler, calming type practices. Breath, mantra, simple visualization, whatever it may be to you. Breath practice, which is one that people like to do a lot, actually potentially contains both facets. The way most people do it, which is fine, is it's a simple concentration device. There's something inherently soothing about the breath as you focus on it physiologically. And it's simple. The mind wanders, you bring it back, the mind wanders, you bring it back. After a while, the mind doesn't wander quite as much. But there is a more advanced perspective from which you can do the breath meditation, where it's being done more as a clarifying exercise. Perhaps you're focusing at the nostrils, perhaps you're focusing at the abdomen. You can pay attention to the moment by moment change in quality, intensity, and shape of the sensation, the body sensation, that the breath is producing at that location. For example, if it's at the tip of the nose, there's a constant change in the direction and velocity of the air streams that are moving over your nostrils, your nasal septum, and so forth. And each one of those tiny permutations causes a distinct little impact of sensation. That means that both the shape of the sensation, the intensity of the different parts of the sensation, even the quality of the sensation is in subtle ways constantly shifting. If you can detect those subtle shifts, you begin to get insight into the impermanence of the sensation of breath. If it's at the abdomen, same thing, but with regard to the skin, muscles, connective tissue, going through tiny jerks, pulls, movements, dozens of them as the abdomen rises and falls. At some point, the sensation of materiality, carnality, fleshiness, body as thing, at the tip of the nose or at the abdomen or in the chest or over the whole body, wherever you're focusing on the breath, the solidity of the body there starts to yield and become more fluid. Now your breath meditation is not merely a calming and concentrating exercise. It's an insight exercise. You're starting to clarify the reality of that little piece of body sensation to the point where it is starting to show you its nature as vibrating space rather than as two-two solid flesh. There's another facet of approaching the breath from a sort of advanced perspective, which is that our habit is to wander. Wander primarily into realms of talk, image and feel. When I say talk, that's an abbreviation for the internal conversations, the monologues, the dialogues, and also the lyrics and tunes that we run. That's part of internal talk. Image, well, those are the pictures, clear or often vague. Feel, body sensations associated with our moods, our emotions, our needs, our reactions to things. We tend to wander into those realms a lot. I'd say that that's our habit in the sense of like the habit, the thing you're used to wearing, your garment. The focus on something as small as the body sensation at the tip of the nose or at the chest or in the abdomen is to over and over again have to give up the habit of living in talk, image and feel. In other words, living in our usual place of self. Each time you pull back to the breath, you might be aware that it is un petit mot, a little death. It's a sacrifice. In certain cultures at certain times, the religion had human sacrifice, something that has certainly gone out of style. It's a little hard for us to relate to, but it was not uncommon in certain cultures at certain times, including here in the Americas. The idea of sacrificing a human being is pretty weird, actually, if you think about it. But there is a kind of spiritual sacrifice, a killing of a human being that is quite legitimate and moral. And that's to experience that you really do die in order to come back to that breath. You die a thousand times. To be willing to experience the poignancy of that sacrifice is a very deep purification, because it's a breaking, if only for a fraction of a second, of the ordinary identification. I am this talk, I am this image, I am this feel. For me, in order to keep focused on the breath, if I use that as my object of meditation, I get an incredible sense of grieving, instant by instant, because I'm dying, instant by instant. If you have resistance to such a narrow focus, you will say, this is killing me. But to really feel, really feel that it is killing you, and to voluntarily sacrifice yourself, makes that breath focus a very, very deep purification process. So, on one hand, it's a simple thing that you could sort of do to develop some calm and concentration. On the other hand, just with a slight change in perspective, being sensitive to the impermanence, and being sensitive to the sacrificial aspect, the ego release aspect of it, makes it an insight and a purification practice. So, on one hand, there are simple practices, and on the other hand, there are perhaps more complex practices that require more thought and effort. But eventually become habitual, and there's an interplay between these two. Another one of the complementary dialectic pairs of this path, is that this path is sort of doing exercises. You do exercises, you get strong. On the other hand, this path has an aspect of, not I'm doing it, but it is done to me. So, there's an interplay of effort and grace on this path. You work to develop mindfulness, equanimity, sensitivity to impermanence, but it may happen that upon occasion, it's appropriate to drop all sense of such work, and just let impermanence grab you and work you. I had an interesting experience a few months ago. I was invited to talk to a bunch of scientists, actually a rather select group of scientists, who specialize in studying human emotions from a highly quantified scientific perspective. In that group were some pretty famous people, people whose names you see in every college textbook on psychology. It turned out that I was one of the last of the presenters, so I got to hear everybody more or less before it was my turn. I was at the Fetzer Foundation, some of you may have heard of that place, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. When it was my day to be a presenter, I started to think back, all the different presentations that I have heard. In what way is mindfulness meditation distinctive relative to the different approaches that I had heard? Because most people talked about being aware in one way or another, and most of the people talked about getting out of your own way. It's sort of almost any growth modality in one way or another is going to talk about some sort of consciousness-raising aspect, which would be in the clarification or the mindfulness piece, and some sort of non-self-interference or non-self-conflictual aspect, which would be the equanimity piece. So it's all sort of similar in a sense. So it got me thinking, how would I characterize the unique features of vipassana meditation relative to all the other stuff I heard? And of course, this was a pretty heady crowd, and there was a lot of pretty technical vocabulary, which of course I love myself. So I decided to make up some new words. Hey, if they can do it, why can't I? To make up some new words and to define them in my own way. And the words were pretty fancy, but they were also pretty cool, pretty interesting. And I think told they do tell the story. Now, you will not find these words in any dictionary, of course, because they are neologisms. They are new words. In fact, they are ideolect. Do you know what that means, an ideolect? It doesn't mean an idiot's dialect. What does ideo mean? Well, it's the same as idiosyncrasy. It means private or personal. Actually, literally, an idiot is literally somebody lost in their own personal world and out of contact with others. It's literally what an idiot means. So an ideolect is a private language. Maybe some of you have some ideolect of your own, huh? Does anybody here have your own words? My dad had lots of words that he made up that were just his private words. So I made up some of my own personal words that I thought would characterize in a sort of technical way what is distinctive about what we do here. We all talked about awareness. So I thought, well, okay, awareness, but what's our awareness here? Now, I'll warn you, these are fancy schmancy words, but I will explain them. You don't have to bother remembering them. They're just for fun, but the ideas might sink in. The first is that the awareness that we cultivate here is ataractic. You know what ataraxia? Maybe you don't. What that means, ataraxia? You can actually find it in the dictionary, a big dictionary. Ataraxia was an ideal held out by most schools of Greek philosophy. It's a Greek word. And basically, it's one of the Greek words for equanimity. In modern parlance, an ataractic means a tranquilizer, actually. When the tranquilizers were first invented back in the 50s, the tricyclics, you know, and all that, they were called ataractics. But that was a word that was taken from the Greek word for what we would call equanimity. And interestingly enough, almost every school of Greek philosophy, the Epicureans, the Stoics, the Cynics, the Skeptics, they all held ataraxia to be very important. In fact, you think of the Epicureans, each of these schools of Greek philosophy has now come to connote something totally different from what these schools taught. For example, when we say Epicurean, it sounds like a gross sensualist, a hedonist, a sybarite, a bol vivant is an Epicurean, especially in the area of eating. But actually, Epicurus, he did teach that pleasure is the ultimate goal of life, that is true. But he said that pleasure is hierarchical. There are certain pleasures that are more fulfilling than other pleasures. And do you know what the ultimate pleasure would be, according to Epicurean philosophy? No. Ataraxia. Equanimity was the ultimate pleasure, according to Epicurean. And you know, it's true. It's true. What I'm about to say, if it just goes in one ear and out the other, don't let that bother you. I will say it again and again. It's pretty subtle. But if you would like a continuous flow of pleasure, independent of external circumstances, I will tell you how to go about getting that. But subtle is significant. I'll warn you, I'm talking about a continuous flow of subtle pleasure. This path is full of paradoxes. Here's how you get a continuous flow of subtle pleasure. You decide, at the core of your being, not to live for pleasure anymore. Didn't Freud write a book called The Pleasure Principle? Okay, The Pleasure Principle, this principle that rules, I'll do this because it feels good. You decide to reject the pleasure principle. Now what's going to happen? You're going to get temptation after temptation after temptation after temptation to get involved in the pleasure principle, correct? One after another after another after another, it will come up. But what is a temptation in terms of its components of consciousness involved? Well, there's a picture of what you might like. There's some talk about how you should have it. There's some unpleasant sensations associated with not having it, that's true. But is that all that's involved? No. There is the euphoric recall, the subtle pleasure that is associated with that thing that comes up. Our usual response to it is, well that's a little pleasure and I want more. I want it to be bigger and longer, so I'll do this or think about this or whatever. But if instead of doing that, you just had a complete experience of that little pleasure that tempts you, you experienced it with ataraxia, with a kind of matter of factness, and then you waited for the next tempting pleasure and the next tempting pleasure and you know what? There'd be another one and there'd be another one and there'd be another one, and pretty soon you'd have a continuous flow of subtle pleasure. But instead of turning into one driving force after another driving force after another driving force, it turns into a moment of unconditional fulfillment and another moment of unconditional fulfillment. Of course, in order to do that, you have to ignore the talk that says get more and longer. You have to ignore the images that go with it. You have to ignore the unpleasant sensations associated with not having more and longer. And then pretty soon, there's just nothing but this fulfillment, fulfillment, fulfillment that doesn't seem to be dependent on anything at all. And the more tempted you are, the more fulfilled you are. Strange, isn't it? But if you read the Buddha's descriptions of his practice, there's a big emphasis on rejecting the pleasure principle, but there's also a constant description of this unconditional joy, the payoff for this equanimity with regard to pleasure. So I know that sounds very strange, very subtle, very counterintuitive. Like I say, if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, don't worry about it, but it's something that you can explore. In any event, the awareness that we cultivate with this path is adiractic. It's based on a kind of gentle matter of factness with respect to pleasure and pain. And in fact, with respect to all sense experience, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, body and mind. So adiractic is just the Greek word for equanimous. But I wanted to use that word because one of the people at the conference was the actual inventor of the tranquilizer. And he really dug my rap too. One of the inventors of the tranquilizer. So that was pretty cool. So I thought, okay, I'll say it's adiractic and then explain it, you know, exactly what I mean. So adiractic or equanimous, it means that we keep the body as relaxed as possible, moment by moment, in a sort of relaxed, open state. That's the equanimity in the body. We keep the mind judgment-free as much as possible, moment by moment. That's the equanimity in the mind. And we just let time pass. And we'll discover that spontaneously we'll just fall into states of equanimity. But if there's not a whole lot going on, we'll notice it. And we'll notice its effect. And then we'll be able to abide in those states more readily. So there's the equanimity that we intentionally create by trying to keep the body relaxed and the mind judgment-free to the best of our ability. And then there is the equanimity that just happens to us spontaneously. And as I say, if we're in a fairly simple environment like this, we'll be aware of that. And we'll develop a sensitivity to what it's like. So that's one feature of the awareness that we cultivate here. It's equanimous or ataractic. The second feature is it's apomictic. I told you I made these words up. Apomictic. Apo in Greek, A-P-L, means off, O-F-F. Or it reverses the sense of the verb stem. It's like day in Latin, D-E. And mixus in Greek, well, it means exactly what it sounds like in English, mixing. So apomictic in Greek would mean to unmix. In other words, we cultivate a kind of awareness that gets rid of the untoward consequences of the components of experience being all mixed together. I'll repeat that. When the components of our experience are a mishmash, which is not a Greek word, they can be mixed together in a way that brings untoward consequences, undesirable consequences. Getting rid of the undesirable consequences of stuff getting mixed together. We need a word for that because it's damn important. I decided to call that apomixus. And the corresponding adjective is apomictic. So we have an apomictic awareness. So what are the untoward consequences of stuff getting all mishmashed together? Well, remember I was giving a presentation to scientists. And besides, I'm sort of a frustrated dilettante scientist myself. So I presented it in a very scientific way of talking. I said that there are two categories of negative consequences of things getting mixed up. There are quantitative consequences and there are qualitative consequences. The quantitative consequences are fairly easy to understand. If you've got physical pain, exhaustion, nausea, fear and irritability, each in let's say 10 units, and you also have 10 units of disconcerting mental imagery and 10 units of negative internal talk, how do we compute your total experience of suffering? What sort of mathematical formula do we put together? 10 units of physical discomfort. By the way, I'm describing what a person goes through when they die of cancer, for example. It's a pretty dramatic case. 10 units of physical discomfort, 10 units of exhaustion, 10 units of fear, 10 units of nausea. You know, when you have cancer, you can have a lot of nausea and things like that. 10 units of, did I say irritability? So two sensations of physical origin, two touches, three feels, each 10 units worth. And you can have frightening visions, negative tapes, each 10 units worth. So how do we compute this whole thing? Well, I would suggest to you that it depends. What most people will experience is that it's all mishmash together. And so the strands crisscross. Well, when strands crisscross, each strand influences the other strand, and you get a multiplicative effect. So, roughly speaking, we would say that the suffering is 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. That's 10 to the 7th power. And what is that number? 10 to the 6th is 1 million. Multiply it by 10 again. So that's 10 million. That's suffering at level 10 million. On the other hand, if a person were to be in contact with just what is, without any crisscrossing or mixing or interactions between those strands, if everything were completely teased out, and all components were distinct at all times, that person's total suffering would be something in the order of 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, roughly. Instead of 10 raised to the 7th power, it's 10 multiplied by 7, or 70. Now, the difference in the magnitude of suffering, 70 versus 10 million, is in essence the difference between 0 and 10 million. Or, put conversely, the untoward, undesirable consequence of components getting all mixed together is what makes what should be a suffering of 70 turn into a suffering of 10 million, ballpark. Even if it was something that should be a suffering of 100 turning into a suffering of 100,000. You get the general idea. One is additive, the other is multiplicative. One is arithmetic, the other is geometric. One is linear, the other is exponential. Our ability to keep track of components, subcomponents, and subcomponents, when you first try to learn to do it, I know, it's no fun. You think, I can never keep all these balls in the air. But it's just a matter of habit. If you're willing to effort and think about things in order to develop the habits of keeping the qualities of sensation distinct, the talk, the image, the spatial configurations, and so forth. Once that becomes second nature, now you've got apomictic consciousness. You can avoid the quantitative negative consequences. In other words, you can avoid overwhelm, freak out. That's the easy part to understand. The hard part to understand is the undesirable qualitative effects of stuff getting mixed together. And this goes to the very heart of Buddhism. What the Buddha realized that was distinct to his enlightenment and to his presentation, and so confusing to subsequent generations, is the hallmark of the Buddhist paradigm, which stands in stark contrast, at least in terms of vocabulary, to the Hindu paradigm out of which it came. And that is based on the following. You hear a sound, and maybe you just hear the sound, or maybe you hear the sound and you get a picture of what makes the sound. Or you get a comment about the sound. That's a bird, or I like that sound, or what's that sound? Or you get a feeling. It's a bird, you smile. It's somebody talking when they should be in silence. It's anger. It's somebody talking about you. All sorts of stuff. Imagine if you overheard somebody's conversation, a bunch of people talking about you, and they didn't know you were listening. All sorts of body sensations, for sure. Self-referential body sensations. You hear a sound, and maybe you get talk and image, or image and feel, or talk and feel. Maybe you get all three. But those are the only possibilities. What you discover is that if you just have a talk reaction, or just an image reaction, or just a feel reaction, there's a sense of self, but it's not the full sense of I am. If you get two of those things simultaneously, it produces more of a sense of I am. If you get all three, you get the full sense of I am, listening. There is a me listening to an it, separate from me, over there. As you continue to clarify what's going on, you start to notice what's actually happening is that the sense of I am-ness, the sense of my own separateness, that I am a thing, comes about to the extent that you lose track of the talk, image, and feel. To the extent to which they get mixed together. Because, see, unfortunately it's not just a matter of talk, image, feel. The talk exists at many, many different scales. Likewise the image, likewise the feel, and they're all intertwined. So inside the talk is subtle feel, and inside the feel is subtle image, and inside the image is more subtle talk. So to pull out the three different colors of subjective sense mode is quite tricky. That's why it's so difficult at the beginning. It seems like it's driving you crazy because you're having to untangle so many different diameters of thread. They're all tangled together. But with time you can tease them out. And what you discover is apomixis. When you've teased it all out, and they're not all crisscrossed like that, you've got talk, image, and feel, and the sense of a separate, limited, vulnerable identity goes away. So the negative consequence of these strands of subjective experience getting mixed together is to create a limited ego. And that's not a quantitative thing, but a qualitative thing. Suddenly instead of talk, image, and feel, you have this critter called I am. This limited, vulnerable, separate particle. And as you separate out these components with awareness, that limited identity goes away. At least to the extent that you keep it all separate. And then what happens? Your limited identity gets replaced with what I cannot call other than a paradoxical identity. An enlightened identity, but it's a paradoxical identity. Because it's a kind of nothing, but it's also everything and anything at exactly the same time. Now we can't conceive of that. You can say it in words and it sounds pretty weird. But I guess we would say it's weird and wonderful. It's a true vacation. You might say that the ability to separate out these components, to get rid of the untoward qualitative effect of producing limited I am-ness, allows us to go on vacation hundreds of times a day, which is pretty good. So the awareness that we cultivate is Adiractic. It's based on the ancient Greek principle of equanimity. It is apomictic. It gets rid of the qualitative and quantitative negative effects of stuff getting all mushed together. And a third characteristic is it's... I love this one. No, I love this. I haven't said it yet. A third characteristic is it's fluxional. Our awareness is fluxional. You won't find it in the dictionary, but you will find fluxion in the dictionary. It's an extremely esoteric word. In fact, an obsolete word from the 17th century. But a very important word in the history of Western civilization. In a sense, that word is behind the Europeans' ability to dominate the world from the 17th century until the 20th century, early 20th century. Does anybody know what a fluxion is? That was Sir Isaac Newton's word. The method of fluxions was what we now call differential calculus. It's the obsolete word, the original word that the inventor of calculus, Newton, used for calculus. And what it means is... well, you can see it's related to the word flux, which means flow or change. Fluxion is the rate at which things change as a function of time. Newton looked upon everything, both dependent and independent variables, as things that change with respect to time. And the rate at which things change with respect to time is called its fluxion. Those of you that have taken calculus know that the modern word for a fluxion would be the time derivative. And Newton wrote it... he would write the variable and then he would write a dot over the variable to indicate the time derivative, which we still use sometimes in engineering and physics. So a fluxional awareness would be an awareness with the sensitivity to the ways in which things change moment by moment. What Newton discovered is that force can be directly observed if we look at the way in which things accelerate and decelerate, which is their second fluxion. It's the fluxion of a fluxion. Acceleration, the rate of change of velocity. So velocity is the first fluxion, acceleration is the second fluxion. In other words, force is proportional or is reflected in acceleration and deceleration. This may seem abstract, let me give you a tangible example. The Hebrew word for spirit, we're here in the Holy Spirit Center. The Hebrew word for spirit in Hebrew, Ruach HaKodesh, translated into Greek as Numa Aion, I guess, and then translated into Latin as Spiritus Sanctus. But actually Ruach means wind, that which is invisible but very powerful. So we're in the wind, but let's say that we wanted to be in direct contact with spirit, with the wind, to know it moment by moment in full detail. If you take a plant, like the cottonwood tree, whose leaves are very loosely articulated, there's not a lot of stiffness in the leaves, or put alternatively, we could say that the stems of the leaves have a lot of equanimity, a lot of pliance with respect to the force of the wind. So if we looked at a cottonwood tree out on the plains, you could see both the direction and magnitude of each little part of the force field of the wind and how it's constantly changing. By watching how the leaves accelerate in this direction and decelerate, then accelerate in this other direction and decelerate, so that you could literally see this insubstantial field of force represented by the accelerations and decelerations of this field of leaves. By the way, that's called a vector field, technically. We have this experience of self and world. We have this experience of our senses. Underlying all of this is an invisible field of spirit. We can contact this invisible field of spirit in four different ways. Each of these ways is valid, but they are different. Three of the four ways are basically similar, and the fourth is really quite a different critter. And all human spirituality in every culture, all human religions, can be basically deconstructed into relative amounts of these four ways of contacting our spiritual source. X amount of the first component, Y amount of the second component, Z amount of the third component, and T amount of the fourth component. We'll give you a perfect characterization, I feel, of the direction and magnitude of any particular path or any particular individual. What are the four components? Well, the first three are we contact our spiritual source by having certain feelings about our spiritual source. Certain kinds of feelings. Piety, love, a feeling quality that we don't have an English word for, but the Romans called numens. This sense of awe that you would feel in certain locations or certain shrines or certain places in nature, that you would sense the awe of the divine. They called that numen, N-U-M-E-N. Numen et lumen. Isn't that UCLA? The motto in Latin? I think so. Numen et lumen. It means light and reverential awe. Okay, so these are certain kinds of feelings that we have that link us to our spiritual source. Quite natural. Some people, of course, have some fear feelings, but it's a certain kind of feeling. And we may have certain kind of talk, a credo, a belief system, a theology. Theologos means somebody that talks about God. Talk, logos, dialogue. We have a theology. We have a talking, an internal dialogue that we ascribe to, that connects us to our spiritual source. And with talking about God comes talking to God. Nothing wrong with that, if that works for you. Certainly works for me on occasion. But that's a certain kind of talk, a theology, a discursive prayer. It's not any and all talk. That we have certain visions, but we don't very much. Not modern people. But our ancestors mostly contacted the spiritual source through vision. In other words, certain kinds of images. You would see your dead ancestors. You would see the spirit world directly. Even in European classical antiquity, this was not uncommon. Apopteia, a word you've probably never heard. But you do know the other word that means exactly the same thing. Epiphany. Epiphany. Epiphania. Phano means to appear as an image in front of you. It has the same root as phenomenology. Phenomenon. People would, you've heard of the mystery religions of classical antiquity, the cults of Mithra, Isis, Demeter, Saul Invictus, and so on. Typically at the end of the initiatory rituals, the secret rituals, people would actually see these gods. And that was called epiphany. And of course among tribal peoples, it's relatively easy to see the spirits. All you've got to do is go without sleep or without food or without water for a while and you'll see the spirits. That's a certain kind of image that gets us in contact with our spiritual source. So those are three ways we can contact the spiritual source. And then there is the fourth. The fourth is not a certain kind of talk, a certain kind of image, or a certain kind of feeling. It's any talk, any image, any feeling, any touch, any visual object, any external sound, anything. Why? Because when these senses arise, we experience their impermanence. We experience how the leaves blow this way and that way. And as a result, the movement of the senses perfectly reflects the underlying field of spirit energy and we directly contact the spiritual source. So the impermanence of our senses turns our senses into the equivalent of the cottonwood tree, whereby we can directly contact each little fluctuation of the spirit field that underlies us. Not just underlies us, but underlies this whole scene right now. It probably doesn't seem that way. It probably seems like, that's crazy, what do you mean? There's a physical room here. It exists in an eternal rigid background of space that we walk through. And I'm a thing inside this space that looks out at a separate world. I know it seems that way, until you start to look really carefully. And then it doesn't seem that way at all. It seems like you are surrounded on the inside and outside by the Holy Spirit for real and always. And indeed, that you and your surrounding scene are moment by moment being loved into existence by that effortless flow. So that's called direct contact with your spiritual source. If you look around the world, you'll see that people's spirituality typically have varying amounts of these four components. It's not hard to see that in the West for the last several thousand years, theology, the talk component, has been very large. Along with the invention of writing and all sorts of stuff. Prior to that, the image component was very large. But inside each of the spiritual traditions, and totally outside of all organized religion also, in each age, in each time, in each culture, there are people for whom that fourth component is the center of their spirituality. And that's basically what this path is about. So when I say that our awareness is fluxional, I mean that we have a sensitivity to the velocities and accelerations and therefore the underlying forces that are creating time, space, self and world moment by moment. In other words, molding our sense experience. And there's an interesting feedback loop, a positive feedback loop that takes place. The more cognizant you are of impermanence, the easier it is to have equanimity. And the more you have equanimity, the more pliant the substance of your being becomes and reflects that impermanence, which then leads to more equanimity, which then leads to more impermanence. Until you become as adoraptic as the cottonwood leaves or as a cloud of vapor. And that's what it means to be spiritual, in my definition. Spiritual means to be spiritualis, to be of the nature of wind or vapor. In a sense, you might say it's sort of bleak, but in another sense, it's incredibly rich and powerful. So, this is how I explain to these scientists, believe it or not, in these very terms. The distinctive feature, there's one more distinctive feature though, besides being adoraptic, apomictic and fluxional, the awareness that we cultivate in this path is critically massive. You know what critical mass is? In a reactor, you have to get a certain amount of the substance involved in the reaction, and then the thing just goes off scale. But until you build up to that critical mass, you don't get these dramatic changes. You can add a lot into the reactor, but there's no quantum leap, and then beyond a certain point, there is a quantum leap. Most paths, from Freudian analysis to Scientology, most paths involve some sort of cultivation of awareness and equanimity. One of the distinctive features of what we do here is that we develop it in outrageously massive amounts. We sit hour after hour after hour, day after day after day, year after year after year, until we get a critical mass of this stuff built up, so that it starts to, so that there's this sort of quantum leap. It takes us into a whole other realm of experience. So it's not a little bit of self-awareness that we develop, and it's not self-awareness with regard to just the surface scale of our being. We go into massive, massive amounts of it, and down into the finest scale of the strands of sense experience. And so I think that the massive nature, critically massive nature of what we do is also distinctive. I came up with these four things that make what we do here distinctive, relative to the kinds of things that I had heard other people talking about. And when I presented it in this way, I got very careful attention. I could see people were really listening, really thought that this was interesting. And later on I heard that unfortunately I had to leave early, you may remember it, was to come here to lead the last one-week retreat. So I gave this sort of presentation and I was out, but I heard a couple of weeks ago I talked to Al Kasniak, and he said that apparently that talk just spurred a whole efflorescence of productive dialogue among the people there. That was very, very fulfilling for me. Anyway, I thought I would just share some of these sort of big picture aspects of the practice with you, and I think that about does it for this evening.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start":
