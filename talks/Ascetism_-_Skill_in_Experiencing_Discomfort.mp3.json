{"text": " I wanted to talk today a little bit about the topic of asceticism. It is often said in the descriptions of the Buddha's life that he practiced asceticism and then rejected asceticism for a different practice. So I'd like to just consider for a moment what this word asceticism means, because I think that it's often useful to clarify terminology and to know a little bit about the background of where words come from and what they signify. As we use the word now in ordinary English, doesn't asceticism usually imply self-denial? What do you think? So-and-so as an ascetic means they live a very simple life, they don't have a lot of pleasures or a lot of complications, things like that. So in contemporary American English, asceticism, I would say in its primary meaning, has, or if you say somebody is an ascetic, it has a connotation of self-denial. Used in the context of Buddhist history and in the context of Indian religions though, the English word asceticism usually translates the Sanskrit word tapas. Tapas means more than just self-denial. Tapas means an active taking on of discomfort for a spiritual goal. There are many, many practices that are done in India and I guess it's no coincidence that the idea of a holy man on a bed of nails or something like that, that image comes from India. That's a good example of a tapas or self-torture spiritual practice. So on one hand asceticism can mean denying oneself certain pleasures. On the other hand asceticism, particularly as it's used with reference to India, usually implies an active taking on of discomforts. Historically speaking, the word asceticism comes from the Greek word ascesis, A-S-K-E-S-I-S, and that's actually a very interesting word because originally ascesis, or I guess we would anglicize it as ascesis, but in Greek it would have been Alpha Sigma Kappa Eta Sigma Iota Sigma, okay, ascesis, originally meant the training of the Olympian athletes. It was actually the physical training that they did in classical antiquity, you know, lifting weights or running or the different things that people did to train for those events. So ascesis really originally meant something like physical exercise. Then it was taken over by the Christian monks in the Middle Ages and used to mean a spiritual practice in general. So in some ways, in that sense, the whole endeavor of meditation is ascesis or quote asceticism. So the word has passed through an interesting history, first being a secular training, then being a spiritual training, then coming to mean either self-denial or perhaps even self-torture. Why would somebody want to deny themselves pleasure? Why would somebody want to expose themselves to discomfort? What possible benefits would accrue to such a person, to a person that did that? If you present the idea of asceticism to the average American, either in terms of denial of pleasure or in terms of actively taking on a discomfort, I think most people would be offended by the idea, threatened perhaps, and probably also confused, unable to figure out a rationale why anybody would even want to do this. The interesting thing though is that asceticism in the sense of exposing oneself to discomfort certainly has been part of the Western tradition. It's left its mark in our language, in some of the idioms of the English language, although the practices have died out. It was part and parcel of Christianity. There are two phrases that come to mind. One is the phrase self-flagellation. How many of you have ever heard that phrase? Well, as we now use it, it means to beat yourself up or to criticize yourself, you've been flagellating yourself, thinking what a worthless person you are. But flagillare in Latin means what? It's a verb meaning what? Literally to whip or to beat. And self-flagellation was a major spiritual practice among Christian monks and nuns. The other expression in our language, which you don't hear so often, but when a person is blaming themselves or wants to take on, not even so much blaming themselves, but they want to take on the sufferings of others and things like that, we have a phrase to wear a hair shirt. How many of you have ever heard that? Now where that comes from is that the Christian monks and nuns used to wear something like underclothes that was woven out of very coarse horsehair that would of course be a constant source of irritation and discomfort if you wore it. Fleas? Oh, I see. The fleas tended to inhabit it. That's interesting. I didn't know that aspect. So it's just sort of like wearing clothes that stick you and are uncomfortable and are vermin infested. That was another ascetic practice. As I say, it's left its mark in our language. So to get back to the question, why would somebody expose themselves to discomfort? Well, I'd like to suggest to you that in fact there may be many answers to that question. That people, obviously it's something that was done, it is done, and if human beings are doing it and if certain cultures say it's a good thing and certain spiritual practices encourage it, there must be a reason. Whether the reason is diluted or non-diluted is another issue. But we have to ask ourselves and investigate why do human beings do this? And sometimes when I describe Buddhist practice to people that have no background whatsoever and they say, well, why do you do, why would you do this? Why would you sit there motionless? You know, why did you put up with this pain or whatever? One of my standard strategies for explaining to people about this is to sort of run down some of the reasons why people might expose themselves to discomfort or deny themselves pleasure and then sort of show that some of those reasons might be invalid and some of them might be valid and some of them might be neither. Well, let's think of some reasons why a person might expose themselves to discomfort. They might do so out of a sense of guilt, right? I'm a worthless, guilty person and I deserve to suffer. The fact that the phrases from Christianity to flagellate yourself and wear a hair shirt imply a sense of guilt and worthlessness. That fact should give us an indication that maybe, at least among some practitioners in the Western tradition of asceticism, that the ascetical practice was done out of a sense of guilt and self-worthlessness and that we deserve to suffer because of our sinful nature, let's say. But anyway, that's one motivation that people may have. Another motivation that people may have is that certain people, for whatever reason and we're not sure, have a certain conditioning where discomfort arouses erotic sensation and they might want to expose themselves to discomfort in order to have that experience. That is usually not considered inside the spiritual realm, okay? But the only reason that I mention it is that a lot of people have some confusions, okay? And if we describe a practice where we expose ourselves to this or that, we'll say, well isn't that masochism or something like that? So I include that as one of the motivations that people have. I don't say whether it's diluted or non-diluted, okay? But we have to distinguish that very carefully from some of the other motivations that people may have. A third motivation that people may have for exposing themselves to discomfort is that it will blast away the surface consensual functions of consciousness and will literally thrust you into certain realms that are deep within the mind that are, I call, the realms of power. In other words, if you go without food, go without water, expose yourself to cold, expose yourself to heat, or put yourself in a sensorially deprived environment, you will start to have unusual experiences. You'll see things, you'll hear things, entities may appear to you, whatever they may be, it's a phenomenon, it could happen. You may find yourself channeling certain forces, you may find that suddenly you know how to heal people, or you have a certain sensitivity about things, or you have a sense of what's going to happen before it happens. Things like this can come about as the result of exposing yourself to discomfort. Now this whole area of consciousness is not the ultimate goal of the practice as far as Buddhism goes. In fact, in traditional Buddhism, it's looked upon as potentially a big distraction. However, it cannot be denied that there is a realm of power within the deep mind, and whether these entities are real or not, that's a big philosophical and psychological debate which I don't have an answer to. Whether these powers are real or just apparent, whether they could actually be tested in the lab, or whether we just get the impression that we have these powers and we can't really point to anything, I don't know. But I do know that the phenomenon certainly does happen to people, and one of the best ways to get in contact with the realm of the archetypes, the realm of unusual reality, which is the intermediate levels of the mind, levels that are in between the surface consensual reality and the source of things, there's that intermediate realm of power. And one of the best ways to do it is to do an ascetical practice, expose yourself to discomfort. The things that I meant, if you look around the world, you'll find that all around the world shamans do the kinds of things I mentioned. Sensor deprivation, sleep deprivation, exposure to heat. In fact, the word tapas in Sanskrit means heat. It's related to the English word tepid. Expose yourself to cold. That's the Japanese way in the Shinto religion. If they want to meet the gods and become shamans, they will typically expose themselves to cold, or expose yourself to some other kind of discomfort. And you'll have an experience of the realms of power, very likely, eventually. It's interesting, when I was a monk in the Shingon school in Japan, now Shingon is Buddhism, but it's been somewhat influenced by the Shinto religion of Japan. So one of the things that you had to do when you did the Shingon ceremonies, before you did the ceremony, in winter you had to go out and break the ice, like in a big tub of water, break the ice, and you'd fill this little bucket full of ice water. And you had to take off all your clothes and ladle these buckets of freezing water over your naked body three times a day during the period when you were learning these Shingon ceremonies for a hundred days. And oh, it's amazing because it's like as soon as the water hits the ground, it freezes. Okay, you're wiping yourself off with a towel like this, and the towel is actually starting to freeze in your hand, and you're knocking the ice off. Okay, well this is not an originally a Buddhist practice. This is a practice from the Shinto shamanic tradition. In fact, the standard Shinto way of accessing the realms of power is far worse than that. What you do is you strip yourself down in winter, and you squat with your hands like this, hands joined together, you squat and chant under a waterfall in winter. You just let that freezing water of the waterfall fall on you for hours and hours on end until the gods appear. So this is another reason why a person may want to expose themselves, because they would get the sort of special powers of the mind. Another reason why a person might want to expose themselves to discomfort is sort of toughen themselves up. This is another thing that's done in Japan. For better or worse, I don't know, but an awful lot of people are attracted to the Zen temples not because they want enlightenment, but because they think that by putting themselves through the discipline of the Zen training, they'll be tough as people. They can take it. They know they can take it. This is what we might call the boot camp aspect of asceticism. So we can think of at least four reasons, a sense of guilt and worthlessness in order to induce erotic sensations, in order to toughen oneself up, and in order to force oneself into a realm of special powers. What I'd like to suggest to you is that there is another motivation that a person may have in exposing themselves to discomfort, and that that is that the discomfort can initiate a process of purification of consciousness. What does purification of consciousness mean? Well, what do we mean when we say gold is purified? There's gold ore. It means there's a mixture of something that's gold and something that's not gold all mixed together. To purify the ore means we heat the ore up. That which was not gold is driven off, and only gold remains. Consciousness is a pure activity of nature in and of itself. It's like gold. What do I mean by consciousness? Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body, and the thinking mind. These six activities are the six modes of consciousness. These activities in and of themselves are part of the effortless flow of nature, part of the perfection of nature, one might even say. But there is something mixed with hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feelings arising in the body, and thoughts arising in the mind. And what is mixed with the activity of consciousness is a tendency to grasp and hold and congeal the flow of consciousness. When that happens around pleasant sensations, the grasping and holding and congealing is called craving. What it happens around unpleasant sensations, the grasping, holding, and congealing is called aversion or hatred. But in the more generic sense, it is a kind of viscosity, a kind of fixation in the flow of experience. So put in more simple English, we might say that there is a habit of fixating the flow of these six senses, and that habit exists at all scales simultaneously. We know about large-scale fixation, it's what's addressed in psychotherapy. Something happened in one's childhood, or something happened a few years ago, the person is still holding on to it. Meditation addresses large-scale fixation, but more specifically it addresses instant by instant fixation of these six senses. Of course, there's a catch-22, it's really difficult to understand because most people aren't even aware that instant by instant, second by second, microsecond by microsecond, these six senses are being congealed. They're not even aware of that fact, because the congealing takes place in the unconscious. By the time we have heard or seen or smelled or tasted, hearing already exists as an object congealed outside, a thing over there, I'm over here. Likewise with seeing, tasting, thinking, and the feelings in the body. When I talk about the six senses, unfortunately what most people will think I'm talking about is not really the action of the six senses. It's the action of the six senses plus that congealing that has already taken place. So it's a little hard to quite understand what these six senses would be like in their form of just being six senses. In other words, in the pure activity of consciousness as opposed to the activity of consciousness that is being fixated in teeny ways moment by moment. In any event, that tendency to fixate the flow of experience at whatever scale is the source of our suffering. As I say, psychotherapy addresses it in the macroscopic. Meditation addresses it at all scales, particularly at the instant by instant scale. Now when a person exposes themselves to discomfort, if they have a skillful attitude towards the discomfort, then the energy that's in that discomfort will break up the fixating tendencies of consciousness. Just as the heat, when you heat up gold ore, it will drive off everything and leave the gold. When you put pain into the body and you have a skillful stance, and I'll explain in a minute how I define skillful, pain in the body plus a skillful stance is like that heat. It drives out the tendencies to congeal consciousness. It literally grinds them up, breaks them up, and you can feel the energy in the discomfort purifying the consciousness right while it's happening. Just as the energy in the waves of water beat at the rocky shore and reduce the rocky shore to soft sand. Soft sand and hard rocks, same substance, but behave in a very different way. So the energy that is in discomfort, when we are skillful, if and only if we are skillful with it, that energy takes the rockiness, the jaggedness, the fixation, and the solidity in the operation of these six senses and reduces it to very, very soft, malleable sand. Now why are these six senses important? These six senses, which are operating right now as I'm speaking, are what, it is through these six senses that the self and the world arises. How do we know we have a self? We have an image of ourself by thinking. We have certain body sensations that come up. If I praise you, you'll feel one kind of body sensation. If I condemn you, you'll feel another kind of body sensation. These body sensations and these thoughts give us the moment-by-moment sense I am. And this hearing and this seeing and this touching give us the moment-by-moment sense that it is, the world is. So when a person skillfully uses discomfort, then they purify consciousness and when consciousness is purified, a very different experience of self and world comes about. An experience of self and world that is far more satisfying than anything that one could ever have imagined. It is, I would compare it to what St. Paul called praying without ceasing. How can you pray without ceasing? You've got to think, you've got to hear, you've got to drive the car, you've got to figure out what you're gonna do, you have to talk to people, you have to see. How can you pray without ceasing? We constantly have to have these six senses operating. Without ceasing means literally without ceasing. Let that be all that is. Well, when the six senses are purified, then their operations become a prayer and one can have that experience of literally praying without ceasing. The whole point is skill. What is skill? When one is able to have mindful contact with the discomfort, then one is being skillful. And when one does not interfere with the flow of the discomfort through one's body, then one is being skillful. Or put in a more precise form, when one is making the attempt to make contact with the actual discomfort and not turn away from it, then one is being skillful. When one is making the attempt to give permission for that discomfort to move as it wishes to move through the body, then one is being skillful. In other words, when one is making the attempt to have mindfulness and equanimity with respect to the discomfort, then the energy in that discomfort becomes an energy for purification. At first, one only is aware that the purification is taking place in a very vague way. One meditates for a few months or a few years and one notices that, yes, positive changes are taking place in life. My sense of self and my sense of the world seems to be more satisfying. But as one continues to meditate longer, the action of the purification from the discomfort becomes more immediately evident, until one finally reaches the point where with each wave of discomfort one can bring a skillful attitude and in that very second, in that very instant, can know, can actually feel the purification happening inside. You can literally feel your potential for suffering being evacuated. You can literally feel the the rocky ego being softened in that very instant. And that becomes a kind of reward, and it becomes easier and easier to take on the discomforts. The whole issue though is to be skillful. Skillful on one hand means this attitude that I've just described, but skillful also means be skillful in terms of what kinds of discomforts one takes on for how long and under what circumstances. The first rule I would say is, or first sort of guideline rather, I would say is, one doesn't have to take on any discomfort that's going to harm one. One doesn't have to damage oneself or damage one's health. The second guideline I would say is that one wants to take the discomfort in manageable doses, because if it's too intense one may frighten oneself away from the whole prospect. So if you take it in manageable doses you'll be able to bring mindfulness and equanimity to it. Another thing to remember is it's not the intensity of the discomfort that really brings the purification, but it is rather the degree to which one is mindful and equanimous. So a very small discomfort with a very skillful attitude, just like a small discomfort that could come up in daily life like being late in traffic, or missing out on something. You wanted to go to one restaurant and your significant other wants to go to another one, and so you had to give up what you wanted. Okay, and it hurts just a little bit. Okay, even a teeny little daily discomfort like that, if it's experienced with an enormous amount of mindfulness and equanimity, will bring about a very deep purification. Another thing to keep in mind is that if one does not have a skillful attitude, then discomforts will bring the opposite of purification. If one is unskillful, then the discomfort will cause more fixation and more congealing in one's being. So there's nothing to be said in favor of or against the discomfort. The discomfort is its power to either purify or pollute is completely a function of one's own skill, one's own attitude, so to speak. So when one understands that discomfort can have a purifying effect if one knows how to relate to it, then one starts a path of skillfully cultivating discomforts, exposing oneself to discomforts in environments that are likely to be conducive to this kind of work. In that sense, I don't think that the Buddha denied asceticism. I don't think that he rejected asceticism. What the Buddha did is refined asceticism, refined it both in terms of theory and practice. He said there, I'm of course reinterpreting, but in essence that there are certain reasons that are valid for seeking discomfort, for exposing yourself to discomfort, the reason being the purification of consciousness. But there are certain reasons that are not valid, a sense of worthlessness, self-worthlessness and guilt, to seek psychic powers, to toughen oneself up. These would not achieve the deeper spiritual goals, but there is a reason that is valid conceptually to purify consciousness, to use the energy that's in the discomfort to break up the fixations. This can actually be done. So this is a refinement of the theoretical model. A refinement in a practical term is you don't have to expose yourself to a lot of discomfort. Small amounts of discomfort, if they're experienced skillfully, will bring the results that you want. Sometimes people think that meditation teachers talk in riddles on purpose, but actually they talk, they're trying to express things very, very straight, and they're so straight that it sounds crooked. If I were to say to you though that the valid reason for seeking out discomforts and cultivating discomfort is so as not to suffer anymore, would you think that I was talking in riddles or that I was trying to actually simply explain something straightforward? Some people would think I was purposely trying to spin their heads around by talking in riddles, okay. But I think if you've listened carefully to what I've said, you'll see it's just a straightforward description. I'd just like to leave you with a paraphrase from a modern Christian monk. I said that some, I felt that in the Western tradition, some people had done asceticism out of perhaps not the most mature motivations, but I'd like you to leave you with a very positive impression of the Christian ascetical tradition by paraphrasing what a modern monk Thomas Merton said. I don't remember his exact words, but it was something like this. I didn't become a monk to suffer more than other people. I became a monk to suffer more effectively. Okay, thank you for your attention and might carry some of these ideas with you. And the next time you either find yourself late for an appointment and you're feeling discomfort, or the next time you find yourself in a Sundance Arbor and are going without four days without food or water, hanging by your own flesh or anything in between those two extremes, you might have some orientation towards the possible value of the discomfort that you're being exposed to.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.48, "text": " I wanted to talk today a little bit about the topic of asceticism.
