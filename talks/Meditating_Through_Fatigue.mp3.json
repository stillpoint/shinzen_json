{"text": " As I mentioned, one of the things that is sort of a benefit or useful in meditating through fatigue is that it's sort of an easy way to go into a calm state of the mind, because to really stop that compulsive wandering of the mind is really very difficult. But as you get more fatigued and more sleepy, it cuts out on its own, if you can, of course, be alert enough to appreciate that fact. A second thing for me, and I don't know if it would be the same for you, I find that when I get sort of tired and sleepy, it really digs down into some very old material, from like, I would say, from about two to four years old. You know when they talk about the terrible twos and when children are sort of sleepy a lot of the time and they're grumpy and petulant? You know that whole period in child development? Well, as an adult, when you're sitting there and sort of feeling the feelings of sleepiness, I find that it takes me back to some of that early period. And that was a period associated with the initial formation of the ego. So that I get a lot of insights into sort of like self-centeredness and the ego phenomenon when I meditate in a sleepy state. As I say, I don't know if that will be the same for everybody, but I found that to be quite interesting also. In dealing with the phenomenon of sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, and I see some of you already slightly subject to it, so I better give you some practical hints right away. I think it's useful to distinguish the category of objective need versus subjective need. This is my own vocabulary, but let's go to another domain for a minute and look at it. You have an objective need for food, correct? How long can you go without food and still function? Well, most people, many days, right? Many days. But how about your subjective need for food? How long can you go without food in the subjective domain? Well, not very long, probably. And if you've never fasted, the prospect of even going a day without food, or in fact even making it to this afternoon without food, might be very, very frightening. And yet certainly, in order to function in the objective realm, you don't need any food today, you don't need any food tomorrow. The objective need for food is what the body needs in order to maintain its activities. The subjective need for food is the need to avoid certain unpleasant sensations. Do you understand the distinction? The need to avoid the physical sensation of hunger is the subjective need or the subjective drive. How about with respect to oxygen? Your objective need for oxygen, could you go five minutes without oxygen and still be okay physically? I think probably so, about five minutes. Sometimes people, you know, they drown and they go at the bottom of ponds and things like that for five or ten minutes without brain damage. But how about your subjective need for oxygen? Ever tried to hold your breath for more than about two minutes? Between one and two minutes, most people find the subjective sensations of asphyxiation to be utterly terrifying and overwhelming. By the way, I highly recommend this as an object of meditation. The states of mind and body that arise as you're holding your breath. It's a very, very interesting thing to explore. You might take it as a barometer of your liberation. Anybody thinks they've had enlightenment, then this is a very simple test. To what extent one is free from the mind-body process. What sorts of states arise after about two minutes holding your breath. Anyway, in this case the objective need is quite different from the subjective need. The subjective need, again, is the need to avoid or have relief from certain sensations. Now, with respect to the thing called sleepiness and fatigue, when we get sleepy or when we get tired, we say, I need to rest. But what is the objective need in this case? Can a human being function without sleeping for one night? Yeah. How about two nights? Yeah. When I was in Japan and I had completed my initial training at Mount Koya, which was a hundred days in isolation, very, very intense meditation, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was feeling pretty tough, you know, and I'd sort of done something that not many people had done. And one of my friends said he wanted to take me to Mount Hiei. There are two mountains, mountain monastic centers in Japan, Mount Koya, where I was, and Mount Hiei. And his teacher lived at Mount Hiei. He wanted me to meet his teacher. So I did, and I had completed a hundred days in isolation. His teacher had completed 12 years in isolation. Okay? It was quite a contrast. So that sort of gave me a little different perspective on how tough I was. Adela? What does that mean? He had not spoken to you? No, it means he hadn't left the mountain for 12 years. He was not to go out of the monastery for 12 years on that little mountain there. I found out that they had practices on Mount Hiei. Well, let's put it this way. The practice I had done on Mount Koya was the precursor before they would allow you to even do the practice that they have on Mount Hiei. It's a whole other dimension. And anyway, this man, Chodo was his name, had two times during that 12-year period had gone nine days without any sleep whatsoever. I should also add that's nine days without food or water or any sleep or any rest. On one occasion it involved chanting mantras. On the other occasion it was what they call goma, which is an elaborate tantric ritual that he did nine days straight without a break of any sort whatsoever. Now this is about the, I would say, the objective limit of human functioning capacity. But the fact is that there are any number of people in Japan who have done things like this. So clearly a human being's objective need for rest must be much less than our subjective need for rest. As I say, probably if you didn't sleep tonight, by tomorrow evening you would say, I have an absolute need for rest. That's subjective. That is to say, it is the need to relieve certain uncomfortable sensations. And of course it's a completely objective, a completely legitimate need. I'm not saying don't rest. I once heard a Zen master say it's difficult to be a human being. It may seem like a very peculiar comment. What does he mean, it's difficult to be a human being? It's difficult to be a human being because as a human being we're creatures of two realms, although we may think we're creatures of one realm. The realm we're familiar with I call the realm of conditional happiness. We're uncomfortable because we're fatigued or sleepy, so we change conditions. That is to say, we lie down and rest, and then we're comfortable again, we're happy again. The second realm is the realm of unconditional freedom or unconditional happiness. We're fatigued and sleepy, and we learn to experience those sensations of fatigue and sleepiness in such a way that they don't cause suffering anymore. And therefore the subjective need for rest is diminished. Now of course there's an absolute objective need which can never be transcended, as long as we are physical human beings. I'd say beyond nine or ten days, forget it. But how a person is able to go for a week or nine days without any rest whatsoever is that that person is equipped with the meditative skills to see through, literally to see through or experience through the subjective need for rest. He told me he didn't suffer after the second day. First and second day were rough, but after the second day it was like fairly easy sailing, because you get in a sort of momentum of breaking through the suffering around the discomfort associated with the need to sleep and the need to rest. And indeed something like that begins to happen in an all-night sit. I don't know how many of you have ever done it. We used to do it here actually fairly regularly, just meditate all night. And it's a very, very powerful experience. What does it mean to see through or experience through the sensations associated with the fatigue and sleepiness? Well, the first thing it means is to make some sort of tangible contact with them. This in and of itself can be fairly difficult. Next time you get a little bit tired or a lot tired, and by the way, it doesn't have to be extreme, it doesn't have to be a lot to start to do this, but the teeny little fatigues that we have in day-to-day life can be used as fuel, or not fuel, but as material rather for this practice. If you want to use a meditative approach, I can suggest the following strategy. Try to actually contact the physical sensations in the body associated with the sleepiness or fatigue. It might be a tingle, it might be a heaviness over the eyelids, it might be a sort of tense, yucky feeling over your cheeks, it might be something happening in the chest, it might be something over the whole body. But there is a flavor of sensation that arises in the body, in fact several flavors of sensation, different types of sensation arise in the body as we start to get sleepy and fatigued. So getting in sort of contact with these in terms of what is happening where and when, I would say is a first step. In other words, to actually feel the body starting to get fatigued. Where do you feel your sleepiness and fatigue first? Give me some... in the eyes, right? Where else? Chest, neck and shoulders, right? Good. Where else? Other people? Back? I think the primary areas will be different for different people. For me, it used to be that I would feel it more or less just over my eyes. Then it extended to a larger sort of triangular area that included my forehead and down the front of my face. Then it got even larger and it was like almost like a rectangle from my forehead down to about my solar plexus of like strong sensation. Now it's everywhere. When I feel the teeniest fatigue, even the slightest, it's like in some way or another, everywhere in the body moving around like a three-dimensional wave. So try to get some specific contact with the actual sensations associated with it. Now if you're very, very sleepy, like on a retreat, this may be difficult because you're being overwhelmed. In other words, you're losing consciousness. So what I usually tell people to do is meditate standing up. And that will allow you to... just the fact of standing up gets enough blood pumping that you don't fall over. You have some awareness and you can start to detect the patterns of sensation in the body associated with the fatigue. Then when you sit down, you can keep contact with those patterns of sensation and start to work with them. The next step after you've made some contact with it is to try to accept those sensations being there. And this is where we get into a sort of an area which is easily misunderstood. In order to work with fatigue, you have to fight with the objective phenomena of the fatigue and sleepiness. In other words, you have to fight to keep consciousness. You have to sort of fight to keep yourself going. On the other hand, you want to surrender to or open up to the sensations associated with the subjective side of the fatigue. And this is where people get confused because they think, Oh, well, if I give myself permission to feel the subjective sensations of fatigue, then I'm going to lose consciousness or I'm going to lose energy or something like that. And it's just not true. In fact, we're going to see that it's very much the opposite of that. We're going to see that exactly by surrendering to the feelings in the body that are associated with fatigue, we're going to get a lot more objective energy going. Now, what does it mean to surrender to the feelings in the body? It means to give them permission to be there, to not complain about them, and to give them permission to spread and move because that's basically what they want to do. So, on one hand, it's like to try to contact something tangible in the body associated with the sleepiness or fatigue. Then, to try at whatever level one can to give permission that it just be there. Now, there's a third thing that can be done. If you can look carefully enough, you'll see that those patterns of sensation, in some way or another, are always shifting and changing. People don't really believe this, but it's true. One of the things that I sometimes have people do when I work one-on-one with them, say somebody comes for a session with me and they're very, very sleepy. So, I'll have them say, I want you to just feel your body, okay, feel your whole body sleepy, tired, and let the awareness float any place it wants inside that sleepiness or that tired feeling in the body. But I want you, I'll say to them, I want you to say out loud what part of the body you feel most sleepy or most tired or fatigued at any given time. And they'll sit down and they'll start saying hands, chest, face, shoulders, face, chest, like that. It's moving here, it's moving here, it's moving here, it's moving here. Of course, whenever the awareness moves into an area, that sensation gets a little stronger. Whenever the awareness moves out of that area to another spot, the sensation weakens in the old area and strengthens in the new area. Well, what is that? That's change. That's impermanence. Rising here, then passing, then rising in another spot, then passing, then rising in another spot, then passing, then rising, rising, passing, rising, passing, expanding, contracting, expanding, contracting. Impermanent, changing. The locations are changing and the intensity levels are changing. If you look carefully, you'll see it never gets pinned down anywhere for even a second. It's constantly changing, constantly moving. Well, now, something that constantly moves is like circulating water, isn't it? What happens when you have water circulating in a hose? Or when you have water moving through a hose? It can actually hold the hose up, can't it? When you have fatigue circulating through your body, it can hold your body up. And not only can it hold your body, but it can move your hands, it can move your lips. The very circulation of the fatigue turns into what in Eastern Asia is called chi or energy, prana. And you recycle that energy in order to either keep yourself upright and sitting or in order to keep yourself going if you're doing some physical activity. So the first step is to actually feel the sensations of the fatigue. The second is, after you've felt them, if you can also accept them. And then, after you've accepted them, if you can also feel them with enough precision that you see they're constantly changing. Then what happens is, believe it or not, you recycle the subjective sensations of fatigue into a kind of energy. In other words, if the fatigue is strong, that means it's got energy. There's energy in that. That energy can accrue to you, can be recycled. There is a very, very interesting link with the case of fatigue between the subjective fatigue and the objective fatigue. A link that does not exist in too many other situations. There's always a subjective and an objective. But in the case of fatigue, there's an interesting special characteristic. And that is that the subjective fatigue tends to influence the objective fatigue. The subjective need for rest tends to increase the objective need. How does that happen? Well, I'm going to talk about something that may not seem to have anything whatsoever to do with fatigue. By the way, I see some of you are yawning, some of you are stretching. Where is it in the body, right? Can you have equanimity with it? Then you don't need to yawn or stretch. In your car, what is the effect, in terms of fuel consumption, of not having your car well-oiled? Of having friction in your engine? It's going to increase your fuel consumption. And does that increase fuel consumption go into productive work for the car? No. It's wasted energy. In other words, when parts of the system grind against themselves, that grinding is called friction. And that friction wastes energy. That's clear in the case of the car, right? What's not so clear is that within every human being, there is a very, very subtle, subconscious, unconscious habit of tightening around the flow of sensation. And that is, to the human being, what friction is to a car. Now, let's say that you start to feel tired, sleepy, yawning, something like that. It means, whether you're aware of it or not, that an extraordinarily complex arabesque of sensation is passing through the body at that time. And that arabesque of sensation is made up of dozens of little wavelets. Each one of those little wavelets, at the subconscious level, at the unconscious level, will tend to be greeted by a clenching phenomenon. And that clenching around each one of those little wavelets produces something analogous to friction. The wavelets, or another word that you might use is viscosity. You know what viscous oil is? Tap water flows in one way, but 50 weight motor oil flows in another way. Motor oil is more viscous. It can't flow as effortlessly. Now, viscosity, mathematically speaking, is actually miniature friction. It was, in fact, Newton that figured this out. Viscosity is friction, teeny little frictions of the fluid rubbing against itself and making friction. Something like that takes place with respect to the flow of sensation through our bodies, but we're not aware of it. When that happens, that wastes energy. So, when a person starts to feel the subjective sensations of fatigue, by the time they felt those subjective sensations, the heaviness in the eye, the tension in the chest, or whatever it is, by the time they felt that, they've already been fighting with it in the unconscious mind. And that fighting with it has built up tension, a kind of internal friction, rather, and that internal friction uses a very significant amount of a person's available energy. A very significant amount. So what happens is you get feedback. The more tired you get, the more uncomfortable you get, perhaps subconsciously uncomfortable. The more uncomfortable you get, the more you fight with it. The more you fight with it, the more that produces friction, which wastes energy, which makes you feel even more tired. And then you feel even more uncomfortable, and there's even more resistance, and there's a vicious cycle. That cycle can be snipped, it can be cut, at the level of sensation, at the level of the habit of fighting with the subjective sensations of fatigue. And when you do that, what happens is you're tired, some discomfort arises, you don't fight with the discomfort, therefore you don't waste the energy you would have otherwise, therefore that energy is now available, and takes the form of the subjective sensations of discomfort starting to flow and circulate, which then becomes something you sort of ride on. Now, why do this as opposed to just taking a rest? Okay, people often ask. Well, that's all well and good, but why not just rest? So I'll ask you. Why? Why bother doing all this when you could just take a nap? Anybody have a nap? Well, you've sat through the talk this long, you must have some motivation. You might not have a chance to take a nap, for one thing. Now, it's unlikely in this culture that you're going to reach the depths of exhaustion that people have to reach on a daily basis in some cultures, even the sort of mild tiredness that we get during the day makes us irritable, brings us down, makes us less than completely buoyant and joyous. Basically, I'm tired all the time if I look carefully enough. Okay? Isn't there a hint of fatigue if you were to really look inside your body? Now, there's some part that's a little heavy, a little, you know, it's always sort of there. You know, my favorite catchphrase is, subtle is significant. Those subtle little yawning feelings, sleepy feelings that we stretch about and move about or whatever, they bring us down in significant ways. Sometimes people ask what's enlightenment like, what's emptiness like. I would say it's like being a rubber ball. It's very bouncy and buoyant. And the waking up of that kind of material, of the tightening around sleepiness is certainly one aspect of that bouncy, effortless quality that I would associate with the realization of emptiness. It's something that you can use because the phenomenon is going to be there. And then, of course, there's always the aspect that you may at some time be very, very exhausted and tired and need the relief. Why not just drink a bunch of coffee or something like that? Okay, I'm not saying you can't do that too, but what's the advantage of doing this as a strategy as opposed to other possible strategies? Well, these sensations associated with fatigue dig down, as I mentioned earlier in the talk, they dig down into very deep aspects of our being. So that we're clearing out a lot of old negative memories and things like that. Because, as many of you know, the body sensations are the channel, or a channel, they are a door into the unconscious mind. Think about it, your body sensations are the most primitive part of consciousness, aren't they? They're the part of consciousness that we share with the animals. The thinking mind, the conceptual mind, which is so highly developed in the adult, that is a very late evolutionary product. The most primitive part of awareness is body awareness. And the body awareness is that part that is conscious that lies right above the unconscious. So the body sensations and the unconscious mind are in a hand and glove relationship. Therefore, one of the ways to release material that is blocked in the unconscious mind is through releasing the blockages around body sensations. The different flavors of body sensations that arise from different causalities link into different aspects of blockages in the unconscious mind. I mentioned to you that for me, when I work with the sleepy sensations, that links into some very early infantile ego formation type things. Other kinds of sensations, for example, the feelings of embarrassment or self-consciousness that you may get, like I get somewhat when I have to talk to a group of people or something like that, those qualities of sensations link down into other aspects of my past. Gross physical pain links down into other aspects of my past. My aversion to cold links down into other aspects of the unconscious mind. And so each one of these sensations carries with it the potential of purification. Purification meaning, in this case, not some sort of moral code kind of purification, thou shalt not or thou shalt kind of purification. Not purification in that sense. Purification in the sense of gold gets purified when the impurities are driven off. So consciousness gets purified when these things are released and you have the true nature of consciousness, which is effortless joy, freedom, what have you. So by making the decision to work with something like fatigue at the level of body sensation in a meditative way, one is given more than just a coping mechanism. Because if we just wanted to cope, you know, either sleeping or a lot of coffee will be a temporary coping mechanism. Let me ask if anybody has any questions or comments based on just what I've said so far. Yes. The question is, is most of our fatigue at the end of the day due to resistances? I would say yes. I would say, yeah, I would say, and even we notice, we call it burnout or whatever. That's why I made that contrast between subjective and objective. And I would say yes. The question is, is the reason that as people get older they need more rest because they have built up more and more of these habits of resistance? My guess is that it is a combination of both subjective and objective. In other words, as you get older, the physical mechanism is objectively, you know, needs more rest or doesn't quite have the oomph in it. It is also the case, it is rather often the case that as a person gets older, they accumulate more tendencies to blockage. However, the opposite can also be true. It can also be true that as a person gets older, they break up more of those blockages because they've accumulated life experiences and wisdom and they've grown. So I think it can be looked at either way. Some people become more brittle as they get older and some people just naturally start to approach enlightenment, even though they may not meditate. And even though they may not be aware of it, they start to go in the direction of enlightenment simply because they've accumulated so much life experience that they've learned not to hang on so much. So I think it can go either way, actually. There are some older people that are very close to enlightenment, but they don't know it. It just sort of happened. Yes? I used to think that I had to take a nap after lunch, you know, just to keep going for the rest of the day because my high energy was in the morning and I wanted to go on with the day. But then something happened in the family where I have to be available and I have more work to do and I can no longer nap in the afternoon. And I find I'm having all kinds of energy. Of course at night I collapse and I can go the whole day without that nap. I mean, it was just something that I couldn't do. Right. An indulgence, right. Or not an indulgence, but something that wasn't objectively necessary. By the way, there's something, you know, I said that you could meditate through the sensations or you can take a nap. There's something that's sort of a hybrid of both of those, which I do sometimes, which is you lie down, but you don't lie down in order to go to sleep. You just lie down in order that the body rests and I meditate, I consciously meditate on the feelings of fatigue in the body. And I find that because I'm lying down, some of the resistance to that fatigue goes away because I'm sort of, you know, I'm sort of coddling my body. I'm not going completely asleep, but just the lying down sort of opens me up. And then I consciously meditate on the discomfort of the fatigue, but in a rested position. And I find that I can open up to it more and it circulates quite a bit, but I don't lose consciousness or not completely. And when I get up from that, which may only be ten minutes or so, I feel really, really rested. So it's a sort of cross between resting and meditation. Of course, the danger is you might completely go to sleep and then you'll lose some of those values, but there's really a continuum between alert meditation and sleep, total unconscious sleep. There's a continuum. And I remember in the Zen temple, they used to joke, you know, about certain monks. They would say that, I notice that you've become very advanced in your meditation, I can tell because you can sleep and still keep upright. And it was actually quite true. They get to the point where they can sleep and their body does not fall over. Now, I've been told, this is through the grapevine, that this kind of meditation that I just described was actually taught in World War II to fighter pilots in the Air Force and people like that. Because they couldn't take the ordinary lengths of time to sleep that was needed. So that they taught them how to sort of get more efficient sleep. And I don't know if they really used the technique of dealing with the sensations, which I described, but it was something like between a meditation and a sleeping thing. But it was done for very, very practical goals of like, you know, just keep them alert in battle and things like that. So it's sort of interesting. Yeah? It reminded me when you were saying that about the quality of sleep too. Like at the end of the day, if I'm like really exhausted, I just want to go to sleep. If I give myself just even 20 minutes of sitting upright, and of course there's a lot of dropping away, but I find the quality of my sleep is better. You know, as you said, doing some head-on. And I was thinking that two-year-old thing you said was really interesting because I find that grouchiness or something. Yeah, yeah, real grouchiness. And I was thinking this morning, because I was very tired this morning, it's a perfect talk for me by the way. That I was thinking this morning, you know, when I'm at retreats I have five hours sleep. It's also, like you said, it's also subjective being there. That's what you do at a retreat, it's not grouchy about it, that's the rule. Right. And I tried to kind of apply it, you know, that it has to do with like preference. You know, I don't want to have had five hours, I want to have had seven hours or whatever. Right. But when that is... Yes, it's very good. You know, this thing about eight hours sleep or whatever, we get hypnotized into certain cultural norms. I mean, I sleep eight hours occasionally, but I think if I slept eight hours every day I'd get sick. I mean, really. And I'm not in all that great physical shape either. I don't have a thyroid gland, you know, and some of you may know at one time in my life I abused drugs and things. I'm not in very good physical shape. But I couldn't take eight hours sleep on a regular basis. I mean, you know, it's like that seems to be very unnatural. Most meditators really are there in the four or five hour bracket is what feels really good, you know, good for them. Yes. Working. Oh, I'm sorry. Repeat the question is, how long have I been experimenting with meditating on fatigue and what have been the effects? Several years. And the effects have been really dramatic. Well, because they become habitual. It's like a whole aspect of your life that was a problem isn't a problem anymore. And not only isn't it a problem or is not as much a problem, of course, the object of need will always be there. But it's like, you know, if you look at it, like I said, if you look inside, you'll see in some way you're tired now. OK, so it's like that even that's clearing up that subtle sleepiness has really increased my vitality quite a bit in day to day life, I would say. And it's like yesterday I gave a seminar all day and then I had to drive back from Garden Grove to here and then I had to drive out to Silver Lake. And I was trying to get like really tired in the car. And then I just remembered because I do forget all the time. It took me a few minutes. I was getting tired. Jesus, long drive and traffic in the freeway. And then, you know, five, ten minutes passed. I say, wait a minute, I know what to do about this. It's like, yeah, I've done this before. I've sat umpteen, I don't know how many times I've sat all night. I mean, who lost count, right? If I've sat all night that many times, certainly I remember what to do with this. So then I got, I was mostly in the chest and then I started to sweep through the sensations in the chest and then started to spread over the whole body. And pretty soon it was breaking up and I was feeling good again. So the effects are, you know, and it wasn't just that I palliated the symptoms. I felt, oh, some part of me softened, some part of the ego became softer by having done that. So it did take a number of years, I'll be frank. But it was well worth it. Yes, you wanted to? In the car? Yes, in the car while driving. Right. The question was asked, you know, a lot of times we have to do something and do something. How can we apply this very elaborate procedure that I just mentioned, this very subtle procedure, while we're doing something that's highly demanding? And the metaphor that I usually use is that these skills at meditation, if we practice them enough on the cushion and, you know, in retreat situations, they become second nature so that they run on automatic pilot to a certain extent. For example, I was driving the car and meditating on the fatigue at the same time. In fact, it's very much along the analogy of driving the car. Once you've internalized the skill of driving the car, you can do other things and drive the car. So this becomes sort of second nature and even though maybe 80% or 90% of your awareness is going into some task at hand, the remnant awareness, which would be going ordinarily into scattered, unproductive things, focuses into a technique sort of for you. And so you're doing it simultaneously. But this does not come, you know, everybody here that's learned how to drive the car knows that it took many months to internalize the skills to the point where you could drive the car, talk to somebody, listen to the radio and think about what you're going to make for dinner. But you can do it. We do it routinely. Now, the skills of meditation are far more subtle than the skill of driving a car. So we're talking about a time frame, frankly, of years, not months, a few years rather than a few months. But if one practices consistently, it will just be there for you and then, you know, it's sort of fun. Everything gets interesting then. It's like having a free, legal, healthy and ever-growing high all the time. Okay, the question is, doesn't this also apply to physical pain, is what I've said. Absolutely. In point of fact, I've been dealing with the subjective side of sleepiness and fatigue as though it were a kind of pain in the body, which in point of fact it is. In fact, it's several kinds of pain. The major characteristic of meditation, of the meditative approach to living, is that meditation is a general theory, a very broad theory that applies to many, many things. In point of fact, it in some ways amazes me that everybody comes back every week, since I only have one talk. I disguise it, you know, this week I'll say what I have to say with respect to fatigue and next week I'll say what I have to say with respect to sexual experience and next week I'll say what I have to say with respect to, you know, anger or whatever. But it's only one talk. Okay, it is in mathematical terms what would be called the general formula. Okay, the general formula means it's the formula that applies to everything, you just plug in the specific variables. Some of you that know something about science may know that what Einstein was working towards was something called the unified field theory. That is to say the most general or broadest description which would take all of the very different forces of nature, I mean electromagnetic, gravitational, nuclear forces, these are very different critters. What he wanted to do is see them all as versions of one super force, okay, and that was called the unified field theory. When a scientist speaks of generality, okay, that doesn't mean vagueness as it does in ordinary English. It means broadness or universality and generality is the thing that all scientists and mathematicians are looking for. And Einstein's criteria for good science was three things. A good scientific theory gives a relatively simple model that applies to many, many, many diverse situations and gives you a really deep handle on each one of those situations. Now can you see that what I just presented to you fulfills Einstein's criteria for good science, okay? And you very correctly pointed out this is not true just of fatigue, you can do it with the sensations associated with anger, with fear, okay? With gross physical pain like my knees are starting to hurt, I've been sitting here an hour, okay? You can do the same thing. So I gave you a specific version today of a very general formula and you very correctly saw that. Yes? You spoke of lying down, because I've had experience lying down and trying to meditate. Well, yes, but I would say also meditate sitting up because you want to challenge yourself, just like a weight lifter. You want to always lift a little bit more than is comfortable so that you'll get strength. So you can do it both ways, I would say, but don't avoid the sitting up meditation. Because, you see, lying down meditation is the most removed from ordinary life. Sitting up is a little closer, okay, because you're upright. Walking meditation is closer still. Working meditation, okay, where you're doing a simple task like weeding, is closer still. So there's a sort of continuum of getting the meditative state more and more carried into daily life. So the least like daily life is lying down. So you want to be able to meditate every place along that continuum so that ultimately you could, for example, get up in front of a group of people like I am and talk to you, talk to them and still be meditating. Which I always attempt to do. Okay, other, yeah, I'll take one more and that'll be it. You talked about, the last question had to do with lying down meditation and earlier in your talk you talked about the connection between meditation and sleep. Is there a practice that you recommend to people for just before they are going to sleep, as they are preparing to sleep? Yes. And could you describe that for me? Well, I usually tell people to just do their usual meditation. It's very good to do it just before you go to sleep and just after you wake up. For me that means body scanning. Thank you.
