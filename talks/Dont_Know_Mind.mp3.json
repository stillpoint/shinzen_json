{"text": " I'm going to do a meditation now that has a different emphasis from the work that we've been doing so far. So far we've been working on contacting the feeling as it comes up in the body, and bringing qualities of equanimity to it. We're going to do an exercise to meditate on an aspect of the thinking process. Taking the thinking process as the object of meditation is quite challenging. But what we're going to do is not work on the whole aspect of thinking, but just single out one aspect of mental processing and work on that. In addition to working on the body sensations. So it's going to be an extension of what we've done so far. The aspect that we're going to add to our meditation as an object is that from time to time you may have noticed that states of confusion arise within the mind. Have you noticed that? Like not being sure. In fact you even get confused about technique. You even get confused about the meditation. And from time to time you become aware of things you don't know that you'd like to know. Things that you're not sure of. Aspects that you feel you need to plan about because you're not clear what you're going to be doing. We've all encountered these types of phenomena, correct? As you've been sitting there. It's true, isn't it? Doesn't that come up from time to time? And if you look carefully you'll see it comes up sometimes in big ways, sometimes in little ways. For example, you might hear a sound and for a moment you're aware that you don't quite know what that sound is. And you want to know what that sound is. Or there's a sense that you don't know and you'd like to know. That's a sort of miniature don't know. Then there can be like gigantic don't know. Like don't know if I should stay in this relationship or not. That will occupy a long period of time. Or don't know where I'm going to get a job. That will occupy a big period of time. Those are like major don't knows. Or major confusions. So from time to time as we're meditating, amongst the various activities of thinking that come up, or amongst the various mental activities that come up, one phenomenon that comes up is the phenomenon either in teeny little ways or in big ways of not knowing, not having information, being confused. Or the related phenomenon of wanting to know, wanting to have information, wanting to be clear, needing to have a plan, etc. We're going to take all of these types of phenomenon, whether they are big or small, and consider them to be a sort of single phenomenon of the mind. And for lack of a better word, we'll simply call it don't know mind or I don't know mind. We're going to try to be aware whenever that phenomenon comes up in either a little way or a big way. And we'll use noting, labeling. And what I would like you to do whenever you're aware of something that you don't know, or you're aware that you would like to know, you feel a need or an urge to know, or you feel confused, can you see that this is all a related spectrum of phenomenon? Whenever something comes up that is this type of phenomenon, which may be very seldom for you or it may be very frequent, just say to yourself, don't know. You're labeling that the don't know mind is arising, the confused mind is arising, the uninformed mind is arising, the mind that wants to understand is arising. And label that and try to do nothing about it at all, except let it be. If it lasts, fine. If it goes away, fine. Try not to do anything about it. In specific, try not to think in response to it. Follow what I'm saying? There's going to be a tendency to want to do something about not knowing. There's going to be a tendency to want to do something about being confused. There's going to be a tendency to want to do something about being disoriented. There's going to be a tendency to want to do something about not having a plan. And the thing that we typically do in response to that mental phenomenon is we start thinking. Instead of thinking, just catch the don't know state and hang out with it. It may last for a long time. It may just hang around. You may find yourself suspended in a perceptual limbo. Fine. Just hang out with that. Or it may go away right away. That's okay too. You're not trying to hold it particularly. But if it lasts, fine. If it goes away, fine. What we're trying to do is pinpoint or develop a sensitivity to the whole range of mental phenomena associated with not knowing, not understanding. And we're trying to have equanimity, a sense of accepting that situation arising in the mind and lasting for as long or as short as it lasts. If you find this technique confusing, you know what to do, right? So no one can complain with this technique that they're confused about what technique to use. And what is the purpose for doing this? As I say, you may get a lot of it or you may get a little of it. Doesn't matter. The purpose for doing this is to get in touch with, directly in touch with the mental force that has been driving your mind to think. Thought is not the enemy of meditation. Thought is another sense perception, like hearing is, like seeing is, like the feeling body. It's not the existence of thought that gets in the way of meditation. It's the drive to think. Just like food is our friend, but compulsive eating is not. Food is healthy, but compulsive eating is unhealthy. Thinking is healthy, except most adult human beings can't just think. As soon as they get one toke of thought, they've got to have another hit, and another hit, and another hit. Have you noticed? It's like the proverbial alcoholic, that as soon as they have one drink, it leads to a bender. If that were not the case, thought would never get in the way. That would be a problem for meditation. And the whole thing about the monkey mind, the wandering mind, and all that would never be an issue. But we have a drivenness to think, and the drivenness to think is to wisdom what the drivenness to eat is to nutrition. It's a disaster. So, what this meditation may do is make you incredibly confused and disoriented. If it does, great. It's been successful. All you have to do, let's hope that that happens. You'll be lucky if that happens, because what that means is it will have brought right to the surface the very core phenomenon that has been driving all of that monkey mind all day. And when you can pinpoint that mental state and learn how to just hang out with it, and not do anything about it, specifically not think in response to it, and not talk in response to it, and not move the body in response to it, but just let the mind be in a state of confusion or not knowing, then what's going to happen is that you are working through the driving force to understand. When a person works through the driving force to understand, something absolutely wonderful, something inconceivably wonderful happens. What happens is that thought, the ordinary thinking process, becomes transmuted into intuitive spiritual wisdom. In other words, wisdom is not so much something that you know, but rather a mode of the functioning, a mode in which thought functions. We tend to think wisdom is certain kinds of thoughts, but prajna, the Sanskrit word for wisdom, refers to a certain mode in which the mind thinks. And it's the way that the mind thinks when it doesn't need to think, when it's not driven to think. You've all maybe had the experience of something happened and you responded spontaneously to it without thinking, right? And you did something that was absolutely perfect and necessary. You all know what I'm talking about? We say, you know, I just did it automatically without thinking. It just happened. You didn't need to think about it. An action happened that was marvelously appropriate without you needing to think. When you think without needing to think, your thoughts become marvelously intuitive and appropriate. I don't know if that makes sense, but if it confuses you, you know what to do, right? So just as when a person has pinpointed the force that has been driving them to eat compulsively, they start to really appreciate their food and eat in a new way. So when a person has pinpointed and perfused with equanimity the state of mind that drives the thinking process, one starts to think in a completely new way. And that new way of thinking is called spiritual insight. So one way to access spiritual understanding is to work through the need to understand. The need to understand anything. That's why in the Christian spiritual tradition, the state of meditation was sometimes called by a very interesting name. They called it the cloud of unknowing. Instead of knowing God, you unknow God. You unknow everything, actually, and then you know God, basically, is what it was. That's how it's described in that book, The Cloud of Unknowing. So this is a little bit of a formal exercise to teach you that you can really rest comfortably inside the cloud of unknowing. But we'll use the technique of noting. First, we have to develop a sensitivity or an ability to detect what the state of unknowing is like in the mind. And then, once we can detect it, we can learn to hang out with it. And this will actually achieve two things. The first thing it achieves is that your mind becomes calm. The second thing it achieves is that when you think, the thoughts arise in a spontaneous, intuitive way and contain spiritual insights that just well up, literally boil up from the belly button of your being. Any questions about that? Feel free to ask, because we're going to do it. Maybe you don't need to know. You don't even need to know anymore. I said enough. Yes? I feel rather clear that most of my monkey mind starts from little bits of aversion. And I don't know if maybe I'm looking at a different aspect of the same moment that you're talking about, that you're just describing the same thing in a different way. Probably. Right. There are many different angles that you can sort of focus in. So, I'm not saying that you have to meditate the way I'm about to describe, obviously. No one has to meditate any particular way. But at least for the next hour, I'm going to have you explore this way of working. Is everybody clear? Whenever non-clarity comes up, say to yourself, don't know. And just be there with it. And try not to do anything in response to that situation as best you can. So, we're bringing the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity, that is to say precision, and allowing to a particular aspect of the thinking process, the aspect called not knowing, or alternatively wanting to know. We're trying to tease it out within the whole panoply of mental events. And sort of, you know, like they say, put your finger on the spot. We're trying to find that spot, what that's like. And then we're trying to learn how to hang out with it. That's the equanimity. That's a kind of mental equanimity. Okay, any other questions before we begin? Yes. At the mechanical level, I notice I've got at least two or three voices going on that interrupt the meditation. And one of them says, you're not doing this right. And the other says, why don't you stop bugging me. And then the third one says, why don't you two guys get together and we'll all go meditate. That's right. And I try some techniques and they don't seem to work. Can I say that at that point I don't know and regard that as a not knowing and a desire to know? Yes, correct. I'm not sure which of the voices is me. That's another don't know. Which one am I? Am I the one that wants to turn to the right, the one that wants to turn to the left, or the one that wants those two guys to decide which one is me? Which one of those three am I? There's always three, as soon as you're confused. When you're confused you have two, but as soon as you have two you have three, the one you mentioned. The third one that wants the confusion to be over. One says, I'm going to stay in the relationship. The other says, I'm going to leave this relationship. And the third self says, I need to figure out whether I'm going to stay or leave. So as soon as you have two people inside of you, you have three people inside of you, as you correctly pointed out. Not knowing which of the three you are is fine, as far as this exercise goes. This is a very good exercise for multiple personalities. What I'm going to have you do is, this is not going to be a replacement for the meditation that we've done. It's going to be an extension of the object of meditation. Continue to allow the awareness to freely float in the body and be aware of any and all sensations. And if you wish to label them, fine, you can label them. And then, whenever the mental state of not knowing arises, you label that, don't know. And watch that for as long as it lasts. If it lasts for a long time, fine, then stay with it. But if it goes away, then come back to the body sensations. So you're trying to, in a sense, watch both the mind and body at the same time. But the only thing that you're labeling in the mind is the state of don't know. Don't bother to label other stuff. So ignore other mental events. And if the state of don't know doesn't arise, then let yourself come back to whatever is in the body. And what you may discover is that associated with the state of don't know are distinctive body sensations. Perhaps vulnerable feelings, perhaps panicky feelings, indescribable feelings, will come up either subtly or obviously in the body as you're doing this. And you want to be sure, of course, to pay attention to those, the reactions that may take place in the body as you're allowing yourself to hang out in uncertainty in the mind. Okay? Does that make sense? Is everybody clear about the object of meditation? If you're not, you know what to do. If halfway through this exercise, you say, I don't know what I'm doing or why, you know exactly what to do. Don't know. Okay. It's okay. You don't need to know what you're doing or why. This is called picking yourself up by your own bootstraps. Okay. Anything else? All set? Okay. Let the awareness freely float within the body. And whenever an area calls your attention, let the awareness soak down into it and open up to the sensation there. And you can label the location to help remind you to feel it and open up to it. But also let the awareness move into the thinking process. But pay attention only to one phenomenon in the mind should it come up, which is the phenomenon of not being mentally clear, lack of clarity about something. The lack of clarity may come up in a big way or a little way. It can come up as confusion. Is it this or is it that? Should I do this? Should I do that? It can come up as a wanting to have information, a needing to know. It can come up as a realization that one doesn't know something. It can come up as a generalized chaos and disorientation. It informs that this don't-know mind can arise. Whenever some aspect of don't-know mind arises, label don't know and be with it. The state of consciousness may last just an instant or it may last quite a while. Stay with it as long as it lasts and then go back to feeling the body until the next state of don't-know arises in the mind, in which case label it and try to do nothing about the fact that you don't know. Try to do nothing about the fact that you're not clear. Just be with that. So with respect to the feelings in the body, there's a moment by moment equanimity. And with respect to the need to know in the mind, there is also equanimity whenever that arises. If you become confused about the technique or the object of meditation, what am I doing? Why am I doing this? Certainly that is a state of don't-know. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. One need not try to search for the don't-know states. They'll be evident when they come up. Just be with the body. Be with the mind. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. It's possible that the state of don't-know may be evoked by the words that are giving the guidance. The need to understand the words may become evident, how that arises moment by moment. The need to convert the sounds of this voice into meaning is part of the don't-know mind. It doesn't know its sounds. It doesn't know what the sounds mean. It wants to know. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. The object of meditation is broadly any and all body sensations, and specifically any mental state of confusion or uncertainty, learning how to detect uncertainty in the mind, and learning how to do nothing about it, except the mind being in an uncertain state. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. As the result of this practice, there may be a lot of uncertainty and confusion evoked. Fine. Then just stay with that. Stay continuously with that. See if you could abide indefinitely that way. Or hardly any uncertainty may arise. Then just stay in the body. Specifically, if uncertainty, confusion, disorientation, lack of knowledge, need for knowledge evokes feeling states, see if you can detect them as feeling states in the body. May be panic, may be frustration, may be sadness, may be other indescribable flavors. The exercise may cause body reactions. Good. Pervade them with equanimity. The exercise may even bring a person to a feeling like they're boxed in a corner, suffocated, in a corner where it can't go anywhere. Like it's going to kill you. See if you can hang out. Just be in that state. This is the process of the self not dying, but rather melting. So many things in our life and in this world that are unknown, perhaps unknowable. So many sources of confusion and uncertainty. What to do? One strategy is to respond by thinking. Another strategy is to respond by not thinking. The former strategy leads to information. The latter strategy leads to wisdom. The former strategy leads to wisdom. But what about the issues of life that are so important that we absolutely need to have answers? For just a short time, just a short time, practice being with the state of not having answers for even that, which is so important that it shakes heaven and earth.
