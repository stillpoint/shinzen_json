{"text": " I wanted to talk about another strategy for bringing the awareness to feeling, that is to say to body sensation. As I mentioned, there are three things that one should always be clear about when one does this practice. The first is the general principles of the practice. We have this thing called experience. We bring the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity to experience. As a result of that, we initiate a process, a natural process, of insight and purification. One should always be clear about what the designated aspect of experience that one is working with is, and of course that can change, but that is the so-called object of meditation. During a given sitting, you usually maintain the same object of meditation. And one should be clear about the procedure, the technique that is going to be used, in other words, we might call it the strategy, for bringing the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity to that particular defined aspect of experience that is our object of meditation. So far, in terms of what I've taught you in these group interviews, our object of meditation has been defined as the body sensations, one of the six doors of perception. And the procedure that I taught you was to let the awareness freely float within the body and to be aware of locations. And when you felt a location, let the awareness soak into it, really be with it, but also move on, be ready to move on, so you get a sense that the awareness can circulate. It either circulates globally through the whole body, or if it stays in one region, you feel it sort of circulating, changing in that local region. So that's one procedure, one strategy for working with the feeling sense or the body sensations. Now I'm going to give you another strategy, which is sometimes called scanning, sometimes called sweeping. It's based on one of the major lineages of the Vipassana tradition. There are different styles of Vipassana, and there's one lineage where they do exclusively this technique. Now, both the word sweeping and the word scanning can be misleading. If you say scanning, you might think that you're trying to visualize the body as you go through it, which is not the case. You think of it as scanning in the sense that when you scan a light across a surface, wherever the light falls, things get bright. But you're not trying to visualize or see the body in that sense. If body imagery comes up for you as you're working with body sensation, body imagery, of course, is, you can either look at it as an aspect of seeing or as an aspect of thinking. It's sort of a mute point, which it is. But in any event, that's not the defined object of meditation. The defined object of meditation is feeling. So if you get imagery that comes up when your defined object of meditation is feeling, just ignore it the same way you'd ignore sounds or thoughts. That's just in the background. Almost inevitably, as you work with the body, you get images of what the pieces of the body look like. As I say, that's not your defined object of meditation. Unless you choose to make it such. So you simply ignore it. The trouble with the word sweeping, again, think of sweeping as like the movement of sweeping. Don't think of it in the sense that you've got a broom and you're going to sweep something out of you. You're trying to get, sweep the pain out of the body or somehow move the sensations out of the body by sweeping. Again, it's sweeping in the sense of methodically moving. Now, before I introduce this technique, I'd like to speak in a more general sense about a very basic theme in working with vipassana. And that is the theme of what we might call scales or orders of magnitude. If you look at a tree, there's a tree right out there out the window. The basic picture of a tree is, it's got a main trunk and then there are branches that come off of that. So you've sort of got a big stick and little sticks. But if you look at one of the branches, you'll see what's going on. There's the branch and there's branchlets. So again, you have a big stick with many little sticks coming off at right angles. And look at one of the branchlets. There's the branchlet and there's the twigs. Again, a bigger stick and a lot of little sticks. Look at the twig. There's a twig and there's leaves. Look at the leaf. There's a midrib and then there's the veins that go out from that. Now, the veins have all sort of fused, so it becomes like a sheet. But really, if you hold a leaf up to the sun, what do you see? You see a miniature tree. So that basic pattern is repeated over and over again at smaller and smaller scales. And this is indeed true of all natural structures and processes. They contain scales to them. That's why when you were in high school and you had a microscope, your microscope had a nose piece and you had like 10x, 100x, 300x. You had different magnifications available to you because you wanted to be able to take the same object and look at it at one scale, then look at it at a finer scale, more magnification, then look at it at an even finer scale, very high magnification. It is also true with respect to the six senses that each event in the six senses has something like a trunk and then there are branches that go off from that. But if you investigate the branches, you'll find they have branchlets. And if you investigate the branchlets, you find they have twigs, etc. In other words, our senses are part of nature and therefore they have the characteristic of nature, which is that they are structured at various scales. Now the whole purpose of vipassana meditation is that the awareness simultaneously penetrate into as many scales or levels of magnification as possible. And that's why I always talk about what is meant by attentiveness or mindfulness is to be able to detect the components, subcomponents, sub-subcomponents, and sub-sub-subcomponents of a given experience. So when you're having a thought, that's the trunk. But if you look carefully, surrounding that are all sorts of unconscious thoughts. Those are the branches and branchlets. When you have, your knee is hurting or your back is hurting as you're sitting there, that's the trunk. But it sends out ramifications. Literally what is meant by the word ramification in Latin is branches. It sends out ramifications subtly through the whole body. When we work with body sensation and we label face, chest, arms, whole body, this is a very good technique for seeing the trunk and the major branches. It sort of gives you the big picture. If you want to develop the sensitivity to detect the more subtle feeling or body events, then the technique of sweeping is quite useful. The technique of sweeping is by and large, most people find it by and large more difficult, more challenging than just letting the awareness freely float and labeling the sensations. But it develops a sensitivity throughout the whole body that allows you to detect subtle events. And you've already heard me say ad nauseum, subtle is subtle is significant. The tiny, wispy sensations that arise within us, as well as subliminal thinking also, the really tiny thoughts and the really tiny body sensations have an immense impact on our perception and behavior. Just like the leaves are very light relative to the trunk, but really almost all of the photosynthesis, all the action in the tree is in the leaves. An enormous amount of the really significant part of our experience is in the subtle body sensations and the subtle thoughts. So in order to detect what is wispy and subtle and fine, you need to have what's called resolution power. Resolution power is somewhat related to magnification, but it's not quite the same thing. If you look at the difference between a photograph that you see in the newspaper, a color photograph in a newspaper, versus a color photograph in Life magazine, you notice that the color photograph in Life magazine has an enormously crisper quality, and you can detect much more detail. That's because there are many, many small dots in the Life or National Geographic, and there are a few big dots that make up the picture in the newspaper. So we say that the photograph in one has higher resolution than the photograph in the other, or on your computer screen. Nowadays, since people have computers, you're used to changing the level of resolution on your computer screen from blocky to like really fine. The technique of sweeping basically develops a high resolution for the somatic screen of your body, so that you're able to detect events everywhere. What the technique involves is very simply, you methodically move the awareness through the body, either through the whole body or through parts of the body, and you attempt to detect sensation in each place where the awareness is moving through. What typically you will detect is nothing. That's one of the reasons why this, the people find this a little bit of a challenging or frustrating technique. A lot of times as you move your awareness through parts of the body, you really can't detect much going on. Although I promise you, every cubic millimeter of your body is alive with sensation, by definition. The nerves are alive, they're perceiving. But we're pretty dense. So people have a lot of difficulty sometimes as they sweep through, if they don't detect much. I will just tell you that it doesn't matter if you detect or not. The act of sweeping the awareness through the body sensitizes the body, and it develops this high resolution. Eventually what happens is that the entire body becomes like a screen, and you can see played out in three dimensions your whole feeling life, the whole feeling part of emotion, everything. You just see it as three-dimensional changing arabesques of sensation. Like your whole body is filled with an amoeba, or a lava lamp, and the feelings are like constantly circulating throughout that volume of space. So the sweeping technique, you know, like they say there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is it really sensitizes and raises the resolution power and the magnifying power of your field of feeling. The bad news is that it does require an enormous amount of patience, an enormous amount of concentration. That's why I don't teach it as the only technique. But it certainly is a valuable technique. So this is in terms of the general theory. You can use the free-floating awareness to sort of give you the big picture with the labeling of the locations, and you can use the sweeping to give you more close-up view of what's going on in the field of feeling. And of course you can alternate them just like when you make a movie, you know, you have what they call establishment shots where you sort of see the whole thing, but then you do close-ups. In fact, the sweeping is sort of like tilting and panning the camera over the scene. Together, they can give you both a sort of big picture and a detailed small picture. As far as how the technique works, actually it can be done in a variety of ways. In fact, in a sense, any pattern is okay as long as you keep the awareness moving through the body. But I'll give you some sort of standard patterns. One standard pattern is you start by feeling whatever you feel at the very top of your head, at the crown, and then you slowly move the awareness down, down the scalp, and then down the head and face, down the neck, and you move it down. You feel both arms and the chest area and everything, and you just come down, then you come down the legs, and you come down to the tips of the toes, and then you start back up again. So you're basically treating the body as though it were a cylinder. This gets to be a little difficult to do when you're sitting in the lotus posture. It's easier to do if you're either standing, lying down, or if you're sitting in seiza, which is with your legs tucked under you, because you can still more or less treat the body as a single tube, even though it's twisted a little bit. The lotus posture is probably the most inconvenient posture with your arms out like this or whatever, to sweep through in that sort of way that I described, but they do do it that way. The awareness can either sweep over the surface of the body, in which case it's sort of like a donut going up and down your body, or it can sweep into the body. If you detect things inside, it can be, in that case, it's more like a cutting plane. In fact, what it would really be like would be like what's called a CAT scan that moves. It's like a moving tomographic scanning that goes up and down the body. So either way is okay. You can just pick up events in the surface of the skin, or you can attempt to penetrate down and really feel what's in the muscles, in the bones, etc., as you sweep through. The sweeping could be done slow. It can be done fast. How slow? Well, maybe, you know, a half an hour just to go to the tips of the toes, another half hour just to come back. That would be a very, very slow scan. How fast? Well, when the body really opens up and you develop a lot of sensitivity and you get a lot of sort of vibration and pleasant sensation and things like that, subtle little vibrations to the body, it becomes possible to sweep from head to feet in one out breath and sweep from feet to head in one in breath. So anything, you know, any speed between taking a half hour to like taking just really a few seconds, any of those speeds are okay. You can vary the speed. As I say, you can penetrate in or just go over the surface. And you can do it not only over the whole body, but you can do it region by region. You could just sweep up and down your right arm for a while and sweep up and down your left arm for a while. Or if you have areas of intensity, like when I'm hungry, I'll start sweeping back and forth, you know, sweeping through the sensation. I should say that when you get good at this, you can not only sweep up and down, but you can sweep side to side. You can sweep front to back. You can sweep all different kinds of ways. So as I say, there are a number of possible patterns. You can either do it globally over the whole body, or you could do it locally, region by region, or you can pick certain sensations and just sweep through them. You could do it at different paces, and you can either do it over the surface or down into the sensation. When you do this, you don't do any labeling. This is done completely silently. That's another thing that makes it a little bit challenging. It's a little easier to get spaced out with it. So this is a brief introduction to the rationale and the technique of what we call sweeping or scanning. As I say, another strategy, another way of working with the sense gate called feeling. So what I'd like to do now is open it up and see if anybody has questions. And those questions can be either apropos of the techniques that we've done so far, or about the sweeping. Yeah, Allison? Well, I remember that you told us that when you go to a sitting, you don't change the object of meditation. Could you change from labeling to sweeping? Can you change your procedure in a sitting? You could do that. I wouldn't do it like all the time, but your object of meditation has stayed the same. The only thing that's changed is your procedure. In fact, sometimes when people have really intense sensations, what I'll have them do is sweep and then label and then sweep and then label alternate like that. So in theory, you can do that. When you're sweeping and you encounter an area that has relevance, no feeling or no feeling, does it help to kind of imagine that you're going through that area? Imagine would be making your object of meditation the visual sense or the thinking sense. Right, I understand what you mean. You try to feel your awareness moving through that area. And basically what you try to do is detect the blankness there. That's the sensation, the zero sensation. But it's okay to have that sense that you're moving it through. You have to have that sense that you're moving it through. And if you encounter areas that are special in some way, either have interesting sensations or painful sensations or blankness, when you do the sweeping itself, you don't treat them in any way different. You move at the same pace. But then you can go back and sort of work in those areas individually. But as far as when you do a sweep of an area, you don't sort of slow down because there's something intense or something interesting. You just sweep same pace through everything. But then as I say, after you've swept the whole body, then you can go back and sort of pick up either blank places or intense places and locally sweep them or locally label and note inside them. Yes. The question is, are you increasing the sensitivity or are you just making sensations happen because you're putting your awareness there? Well, certainly it is the case. Wherever you put your awareness, that activates sensation there. However, if you methodically go back and forth, back and forth over an area, putting your awareness in a systematic way, the cumulative effect of that is to increase the sensitivity in that area. So the increased sensitivity is the net effect of having done this many, many times. You're sort of literally learning how to pump awareness into every cubic centimeter of the body. And when you're able to feel the entire body in an integrated way, you discover that all other aspects of your life seem to become more integrated also. The body becomes a screen for the entire emotional life. It's an extraordinary technology. So yes, indeed, of course it's true just by paying attention, you cause sensation to arise there. But by doing that over and over again, you leave a residue of sensitivity. You literally are retraining the nerves. In fact, the thing that's good about this technique is also the thing that's bad about this technique. The bad part is at first you don't detect much and a lot of people get frustrated. That's why I say just keep sweeping through even if you don't detect much. But the bad part is that once you do start to detect, you get really sensitive. And it's like there's no minor irritations. Every little thing is like really magnified. And of course, that's why your equi... just remember this phrase, your equanimity must keep pace with your sensitivity. But sometimes the sensitivity runs ahead of the equanimity and then you get problems. But eventually it catches up. So this can leave a person very, in a very profound feeling state, which of course is desirable as long as you have the equanimity. During the time you're doing the sweeping, if there's a pain or discomfort in another part... Ignore it. You don't let it in and it's pulling on you. Yeah. So if there's a significant sensation elsewhere while you're doing the sweeping, you completely ignore it. So in other words, in some ways, this is the opposite procedure of what you've been doing. What you've been doing is letting the awareness freely float wherever it wants. Now you're doing something under high control. Okay. Now, if you remember my remark about the fact that there is no such thing as a local sensation, if you're sweeping through your stomach and you get a strong pain in your shoulder, that pain in the shoulder is sending influences that go everywhere in the body, including in the stomach. So in order to work with the pain in the shoulder, you can work with it by going through the stomach, just as much as you can work with it by going to the intense local area, because you're dealing with some of the branches that are down there as you're sweeping through. Well, every place is connected with every other place. Think of your body as being like a pool of water. So a water bug, teeny little water bug, lands in one part of the pool. That affects the whole pool, if only subtly. What to say if a fish is frolicking, you know, or you have like a marlin or something in the middle of the pool, then it really causes waves everywhere. So think of feeling, think of the body as being an elastic medium. That's what water is. For a physicist, water is what's called an elastic medium. An elastic media will, if there's any disturbance in any part, it will propagate as waves. Air, of course, is an elastic medium. That's why you can hear these sounds. So yeah, it's all connected. I have a lot of feelings of stress. My shoulders have been killing me the last few days. Yeah, every part is connected with every other part. You'll find the influence of your stomach too. When you have a discomfort in one part of the body, okay, let's say your stomach hurts, it hurts bad. What do you do? You squinch your shoulders, you grimace your face, okay, you shake your arms. Okay, what does that mean? That means there's something in the shoulders, actual sensation. There's actual sensation in the face. That's why people grimace and scream. There's actual sensation in the arms. That's why they shake, like when you're angry or something. So that is propagating influences throughout your whole body, but very subtle influences, but subtle is significant. So you will have a complete experience of the pain in your stomach when you can feel not only the local event in your stomach, but how it has influenced everything in your body. And when you are able to detect and open up to the entire gestalt, the whole constellation of those influences, you will have a complete experience of the pain in your stomach. The way you have a complete experience of the pain in your stomach, it will not be an experience of a problem anymore. Victor? I'm not clear on something. If you're starting a period of meditation with this technique, you designate you're either going to sweep the whole body or a specific part of the body. No, you can, during a given period, you can definitely alternate, sometimes doing the whole body, sometimes doing parts. So in other words, one of the women's questions about going to another part of the body, you don't leave where you are unless you designate that as the new body. That's right. What you can do is, typically what you do is, you do a number of sweeps over the whole body, and then you sweep through local regions. And then you do a number of sweeps through the whole body, and then you sweep through local areas. And you alternate local and global work during an individual sitting. One of the guided meditations you'll be doing will be showing us this in actual... That's what's coming up next. And tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning too. The instructions here are always correlated with what you get in the guided meditations. Yes, I think it was Harry. Yeah. Yeah. Shunsen, this is a real simple one, but I haven't figured it out. I can't make it go in sync. When I do the total body sweep, and I start from the head and go down to the toes, I can't figure out how to get the arms in there. I'm looking for maybe how you do it yourself. Do you actually do the arms on the way down as you do it in trunk? I do the arms on the way down with the trunk. You know, an image that might help is, if you were to imagine yourself with your head under the water in a tub of water, and then as you come out of the water, how the water line would feel against your body, then you would more or less feel it in circles around your arms and in a larger circle. So if you were to take a cross section, there'd be sort of the big oval of your trunk, and then there'd be a couple of small ovals of your arms. You sort of feel it that way. So you can imagine yourself like... Some people say you imagine yourself like a tank that's being drained and filled up, or you can imagine yourself like in a pool coming out and coming down. Some people imagine themselves like being a mummy that's being unwrapped and wrapped up again. Whatever image works for you. How do you feel your leg in the lowest position? A number of possibilities. Some people divide it, split it in two, and go down the two legs. If your legs are like this, say you sweep down, you swept basically yourself like a post. Then you get to the full or half lotus. Some people divide it like this, and then go to the tips and then go back. If that's too complicated, you can just fan out into it. It's a little hard to put into words. You basically treat yourself as though you were still a post. Okay, this is awkward. You're going down this way, and then you would just keep fanning through this. And then when you reach the bottom, you come back up, except you happen to be bent this way. So you fan down into it this way. The lotus is not the best posture for doing the sweeping. The best is the corpse posture or the standing up, and I'll be having you guys do some of it in those parts. I can't do the corpse part. We're a little too crowded here, but have some of you do it standing up. But you can certainly go to your room, lie down. Then you guys can do the standing up. You can lie down. Then you've got your arms really close to your body. You basically are very much in a cylindrical configuration, and it's easy to sweep over or through. It's important to realize when you do the sweeping that what you are doing is you are detecting and accepting whatever qualities of sensation are there. You're not trying to dissipate them or make them change in any way. You're not trying to release them. You're just feeling and opening up to whatever is there as you sweep through. Good. Other questions? Yes. I was going to retreat. I had no problem following the breath, but when I started to sweep, I would get nauseous. Is that common? In general, people getting nauseous when they meditate, either with the breath or with any object, is not an uncommon thing. This would be actually an interesting research. It's frequently reported. I have no idea why it happens. I know that it's not a sign that you're doing anything wrong. I also know that it usually does not have any negative consequences. In other words, people frequently report the subjective event of nausea, but I have never in all my years observed the objective event of upchucking. It's one of those sensations, one of those intensified, solidified, gross sensations that come up on the body and you just sweep right through it. Eventually, you learn how to make friends with every god-awful flavor of sensation that comes up in your... Nausea is one. It's a lot of them, but you understand that every monster in the end turns into a cookie. Is it part of it? Something you know about? What would bring the nausea? No, I don't. That's what I was just thinking, you know. But I've never had a retreat where somebody didn't bring it up. Do I know the cause of the nausea? Why people sometimes get that nausea as they meditate? It would actually be a very interesting research project. Yes? My experience with nausea has been that usually first I feel like I'm losing my balance, like you twirl around real fast and get real dizzy. I get the sort of upside, upsets, like being car sick or something. Right. It might be related to the fact of just being so still that our semicircular canals aren't used to it. Or the other thing that I was thinking is that I know that there's in general an association with when you get warm it's easier to be nauseous. And we do, not everybody has this, but a lot of people tend to warm up when they meditate. I don't know if it's related to that, but I know like people post-operative, you have a tendency to be nauseous after operations. And they always keep the post-op rooms really cold, uncomfortably cold, because it cuts down on the nausea. So I don't know if it's related to that heating effect either. Yes? The question is the relationship between the pain and purification. Discomfort can arise in the body from a number of sources. Obviously one source is just physical, you've got your body in a posture that you're not used to. Another source is physiological, you know your body's reaction to two cups of coffee on an empty stomach or something like that. Another source is purely psychological, you have ideas or things like that that come up, you know negative thoughts, they cause uncomfortable body sensations. Now in either of these three cases though, these discomforts also involve impurities. Okay, even a discomfort that is of obvious physical origin, when the impurity is not itself a sensation, it's the reaction to sensation. So when what causes either of these three kinds of sensation to congeal is the impurity. Okay, so the impurities are going to be present in sensations be they of physical origin, physiological origin, or psychological origin. And so if you observe those sensations, you are purifying consciousness. Now it also happens though that sometimes the impurities come up in a pure form. You may think I'm playing with words here. Okay, remember impurity is the tendency to resist the flow of experience. In the case of pain, it's the tendency to resist the ways in which the pain wants to change. The pain wants to move to the right, but some part of you pushes against that. The pain wants to get bigger or get smaller, some part of you pushes against that. That's the impurity, that tendency to resist. Now what happens is, ordinarily if you have pain at level 10, you will resist it with force 10. And therefore your suffering will be 10 times 10. The pressure that's developed will be 10 times 10 or 100. Ordinarily if you have pain at level 100, you will resist it with the force of 100. In other words, your resistance is roughly proportional to the intensity of the discomfort. So if you have pain of level 100, you will resist it at level 100 and that will therefore give you an impression of suffering at level 100 times 100, which equals 10,000. Oh, you follow what I'm saying? The purpose of meditation is not to get rid of pain. The purpose of the meditation is to get rid of the habit of resistance. In that case, what ordinary people would call a suffering of level 100 becomes for you just a suffering of level 10. You've got just the pain, no resistance, which is quite manageable. What an ordinary person would call suffering at level 10,000 causes for you only suffering at level 100. So what that means is that, let's say suffering at level 10,000 is bone cancer. So that means that you would still go through pain if you had bone cancer, but it would just be pure pain without any resistance. So the suffering might not be much more great than, let's say, oh, I don't know, the flu or something like that, if you were really a liberated person. In any event, I know this is a little difficult to understand, but you'll all experience it yourselves eventually. What happens is that when we sit and meditate, sometimes the resistance itself comes up without any pain, particularly to be resisting. And that comes up as certain kinds of peculiar, icky sensations, which don't seem to be really related or have any reason to be there. It's like your whole body just gets yucky or whatever. Well, that's pure impurity. That's pure resistance coming up without anything to resist. So it comes up as these strange sensations, icky sensations, like you want to jump out of your skin kind of sensation. Now, let's say that you were burned over much of your life, and you were burning your skin. Now, let's say that you were burned over much of your body. You would have the pain from the burns, and then you would also have these jump out of your skin phenomena. The two coming together would constitute the suffering of the burn. So what happens in meditation is you get the jump out of your skin reaction without the actual pain of the burn, and you work that through so that if you ever did have the pain of the burn, it would have very diminished suffering for you. What happens is when pure resistance comes up without much thing to resist, that also becomes a source of icky sensation in the body. And what does that feel like? Well, it has various forms, but sometimes it's a fluish feeling. Sometimes it's a sort of general aversive feelings. It's hard to put into words. But that's another source of sensation. And so if you get strange, weird, uncomfortable, exaggerated feelings that want it, the best I can describe it is you just want to jump out of your skin. How many of you have had that kind of thing happen to you? Okay. Resistance? That's pure resistance coming up. That's pure impurity. Okay. Coming up without anything to resist. There's no big burns. You're not being stabbed. Okay. You don't have bone cancer. But you're resisting or congealing as though you did. So if that's resistance of level 100, well, it's not pleasant, but it's certainly something that anybody can stand. They can sit there and they can observe it. Then what happens is if you come to an experience of pain of level 100, you will only have that pain of level 100. It won't multiply together with the resistance stuff because you've worked through the resistance by having it sap through that icky sticky. So in daily life, if you have pain of level 100, you won't resist it at level 100. You'll maybe resist it at level 1 or maybe even less. Maybe you'll resist it at level 0.5 or level point, you know, whatever. So what happens is that by working through the yucky resistance flavors now, you get a very good deal. What you get to do is by your willingness to feel the discomfort at level 100 now, then what would ordinarily in daily life be experienced as suffering at level 10,000, you'll only have to experience as suffering at level 100. So that's a very good deal. For the willingness to experience suffering at level 100 now and suffering at level 100 at some future time, you avoid having to experience suffering at level 10,000 ever. So what that means is the price you pay is, you know, I call that a good profit margin, okay? You know, if you get to avoid something that's 10,000, but the price you have to pay is voluntarily take on something that's 100, then you might say that you get a hundredfold profit on your investment. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's a little difficult to put into words. But you asked me about, you know, uncomfortable sensations as they come up during your sitting. Whether they come up from gross physical origin or psychological origin or whether they come up from the physiology, the functioning of your body. Sometimes you get the phenomenon of these weird, icky, sticky stuff, okay? Now that's like, believe it or not, that's high quality sensation because that's pure impurity and you're getting a lot of work done when you're with that. Now those are the kinds of sensations that most people hate the most, okay? They'd rather feel physical pain than go through those icky stickies. But the reason I'm saying all of this to you is so that you'll learn to love those sensations and honor them. That's one of the forms it can sometimes take, that's right. It's sort of like the heebie-jeebies. It's sort of like I'm gonna jump out of my skin. It's hard to put into words, but those of you that have had it, you know, sometimes your body actually shakes and trembles because of it. I had one woman that had it that she called it jumpy leg. You get it in your legs a lot. I get it a lot in my legs and things, yeah. Exactly. I once heard a vipassana teacher refer to it as samadhi pain. Most pains, the deeper you relax, the deeper you go into samadhi, the less the pain is there. But this kind of pain, the more you relax, the yuckier it gets. So it is a big challenge on the meditative path because usually the reward for relaxation is you feel better. But once you reach this point, the results of relaxation are you feel worse and worse. The worse, the more you open up and relax, the yuckier you feel. And some people wipe out of meditation because of this. But if you can understand intellectually the model that I'm giving you and remember it, then you'll pass through that and you'll come to what is true relaxation. So that's why I think it tends to happen when we're sleepy because we get sort of relaxed and then the heebie-jeebies can sort of get a chance to crawl up out of the, you know, out of the interstices of our psyche. So I also get it. I typically get it between, oh, say, 11 o'clock and 3 o'clock if I do an all-night meditation. If you ever see me up there in an all-night sit, you'll probably see me just shaking like a leaf for about three or four hours. Then it breaks up. Three or four hours shaking like a leaf, it's a very small price to pay not to have to suffer bone cancer or third-degree burns. Very small price. Once you realize that, you have a smile on your face. You're very willing, very willing to go through that. Yes? I have a question regarding the sweeping. Is it possible if you're doing a head-to-toe sweep to go down the front of the torso and then go down the back? Or is it important to do it as a cylinder? No. You can do it region by region. There's lots of patterns. The pattern is not important. What's important is that you sort of spend equal time in equal areas. You can, like, go down both arms and then come back, and then go down the trunk, and then go back down both legs, and then come back, and then sweep up the back and sweep down the front. There's a lot of ways that you can do the sweeping. It does not, by any means, have to be cylindrical. Going back to something you said last night, when the universe has provided you an object of meditation, whether you're ready for it or not, and you've discovered that the source of the pain is something that's accumulated over a long period of time, and therefore it's kind of really ingrained in some muscle systems, and you've just begun to touch some of this, how do you suggest releasing this kind of accumulated grief, pain? Just use one of the body awareness techniques. Either label it or sweep through it. Experiencing it as it presents itself in the present with equanimity is a very important part of releasing it. There may be other aspects, like acting out, or psychotherapy, or things like that, but insofar as meditation goes, you just apply the technique to it as it comes up. It doesn't matter how deep it is. You just keep applying the technique to it. Yes? This might be a little abstract, but I'm curious. If each pain sends out ramifications all over the body, then there really is no way, even if you say I've got a stomach ache, it may not actually be a stomach ache. It might be something else that happens to be manifesting more in the stomach? I don't know about that. I mean, there is what's called referred pain. You know, you could have an ache in your shoulder, could come from a tooth or something like that, but by and large, what I was speaking of is more wherever you feel the pain, it's going to be sending radiation subtly to other areas. Or it will make its influence felt, if only subtly in other parts of the body. Yes. Okay. Yeah, Victor? I think you've mentioned, or I've heard mention of that, you know, loving something, loving it to death. Yes. When these impurities do come up, or this moment, is that something that you would do, or you would just, in other words, when do you love something, and when don't, you just let it? Well, actually, loving something to death represents a certain extreme degree of letting it do its thing. That's what we mean by loving something, means our object of love is the one thing in the universe that we feel we can be completely hands-off with. You don't have to do anything. We're totally open to that person, at least for certain moments. We're as open to that person as we are to anything. So that's called love. So when the impurity presents itself as a mind-body state, if you are as open to that mind-body state as you could be to anything, have no resistance to it, then that's loving it to death. You give it all the time and space it needs to play itself out in the mind and body. That's loving it to death. Yes. I'm not sure that this is the same that it might be. I've experienced something that seems like, you know, not wanting to be in my skin, and if impurities are resistance, it feels like it's wave motions. It's energy waves that are trying to move through. What happens is that the energy waves encounter the impurities, and that creates a kind of pressure. And if you just flow with the energy waves, then they will, for you, they will break up the impurities. They'll do the work for you. Oh, that's right. As they do that, you'll feel like you're being run over by a steamroller. Okay? And you have to be willing to lie down and sort of relax, relax as though you were like sleeping safe in bed, but and then let the steamroller run over you. Yeah. What's causing the herky-jerky solidified quality is that there is a free flow of natural energy, chi, that is trying to express itself, and it's banging up against the impurities. Let it. Let it bang up against the impurities until it wears them away. Yeah. Go ahead. Do you know? Just sitting still is what we might call the minimal case of meditation. Okay? The point I was trying to say is that, I mean, naturally, if you could do your technique, that's the best. But if you can't, just sitting there has some productivity to it. From what I've seen, like among the American Indians, over my now many years, almost a decade, I guess more than a decade of fairly intimate involvement with the Native American practices here, if I had to characterize the overall, you know, what it's been in overall, what it has basically been is an awful lot of time sitting around waiting. Michal understands what I'm saying. It's just a lot of waiting, a lot of driving in cars to get to places, a lot of waiting around once you've gotten to the places, a lot of waiting around for other people to complete their ceremonies, just a lot of just sitting, empty time. And I think that within the context of that culture, that's where a lot of the transformation takes place. I was wondering, earlier in our guided meditation, you were saying about the body desires and wanting your attention. If you could talk a little bit more about that and explain that further. Well, basically what it wants is, it wants to be paid attention to it, it wants equanimity. Mindfulness and equanimity are to feeling, you know, what, to the feeling body, what food is to the material body. It nurtures it. You come to realize that in time.
