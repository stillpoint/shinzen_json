{"text": " I wanted to talk this evening about a few topics. One is the sort of overall course of where this practice takes us. What is this path all about? One of the things that people sometimes have difficulty with in practicing things like Vipassana meditation is that they don't understand the relationship between what we might call generic insights and the specific issues of their life. In other words, sometimes after a retreat a person will come up to me and they'll say, well, that was all great, but what do I do about the fact that my husband is bugging me? Or what do I do about my overeating? Or what do I do about the fact that I have this health condition? In other words, they haven't seen that the skills that we develop in this practice are generic skills that are applicable to each specific circumstance of life. So this is a theme I'd like you to keep in mind. Whatever issue may come up for you in your life, try to see how ultimately it goes back to the issues of learning how to experience states of mind and body in a skillful way. If you can remember that, then there'll be a very, very strong motivation to persevere with this practice. Over the months and years as one perseveres with the practice, one passes through various experiences. But from beginning to end, the only thing that you have to keep in mind is four things. I call them axioms. An axiom is a basic principle, an assumption in a philosophical system. And this vipassana practice has four axioms, and four is sort of a good number. If you know anything about mathematics, some of you may know group theory is based on four axioms. So four is a good number of axioms. It's not too few. If you have too few, your system is a little too general. If you have too many, your system is a little too closed or specific. But if you have a sort of medium-sized set of basic principles, that will often give you both generality and power. So I'd like you to keep four principles in mind as far as this practice goes. Two of them you already know, that you try to cultivate and deepen and abide in a skill of being attentive. That means being precise instead of nebulous. It means being able to bring continuity of awareness instead of having gaps in awareness. It means to be able to detect richness in whatever aspect of experience you are focusing on. It means to have detail in awareness. All of these are aspects of attentiveness or mindfulness. And one of the basic principles, axioms, is we try to be mindful, attentive. To what? To whatever is relevant in the moment. If you're washing dishes, you try to be completely attentive to the act of washing dishes. If you're making love, you try to be completely present in the act of making love. If you stub your toe, you try to be completely present in the sensations of stubbing the toe. Be mindful of all those aspects. If you get your ego stubbed, you understand what I mean? This happens from time to time. It's equivalent to stubbing your toe, except it's a little more gripping. You know, you fart in church or something like that. The self arises. You try to be as attentive as possible. The second axiom, there's a Japanese proverb, hyakunichi no seppo heishitotsu. It means you can give the greatest sermons for 100 days, but all you've got to do is fart once. People will remember the fart. They'll forget the sermons. So anyway, that's why it's a hard job being a meditative spiritual teacher. One of the axioms is you try to be as attentive as possible. Or you try to be attentive. The second axiom is that thing that I called equanimity. Try to be accepting. Accepting of your station in life? Not necessarily. But accepting of the way it makes you feel? Yeah. Yeah, be accepting of feeling. Don't fight with feeling, because when we fight with feeling, we're fighting with ourselves. The other two axioms or principles I call relativity and consistency. By relativity I mean we can't be absolutely attentive, and we can't be absolutely allowing or have absolute equanimity. We can only make a relative attempt to do so, and that's enough. The reason I put this principle in there is because we tend to be very judgmental of ourselves. I don't have enough equanimity. I don't have enough concentration. Do I have enough concentration? This kind of thing. Of course you don't have enough concentration. Of course you're not concentrating enough. Of course you don't have enough equanimity, and neither do I. We can't do these practices in a perfect way, but we can make an attempt to be a little more mindful than we would be otherwise, have a little more equanimity than we would otherwise. Fortunately, that's sufficient, because suffering is unnatural, and liberation is like a coiled spring. It's just waiting to happen. All we have to do is make the teeny movement that lets that spring free. So with a rather small amount of mindfulness and small amount of equanimity, you can initiate a natural process of release. So when you find yourself worrying and judging, you know, am I concentrating hard enough, and why can't I do this better? Go back to that principle of relativity and just ask yourself, am I trying? Am I making some effort? Am I more attentive than I would be otherwise? Am I more accepting than I would be otherwise? That's good. The third principle, a fourth principle or axiom is consistency. That means no matter what comes up, consistently attempt to observe it with mindfulness and equanimity. What do I mean by what comes up? Well, you could, as the result of this practice, you could have very pleasant experiences. It could happen that you, it would be like nectar flowing through your body or bliss or bright, clear light. Or you could encounter the realm of archetypes. You could literally talk to gods and goddesses, just like you could talk to a human being. I mean literally. See them, touch them, smell them. They're just as real as anything could be. That could happen to you somewhere along the line in your process of meditation. If you have startling experiences, unusual experiences, interesting experiences, blissful experiences, just observe. Observe them the same way you would observe the banal and ordinary experiences of itches and pressures, the same way you'd observe the breath. If the realms of the gods and goddesses open up to you, literally, and you can simply observe if the realms of the demons and monsters open up to you and you see them, and yet you simply observe them with equanimity and you're aware, changing, changing. OK, now this demon, now that demon, now that foxy goddess, now this foxy goddess. OK? You're laughing but it could happen to you somewhere along the line. And I'm not talking about hallucinations. Well, I am, I mean, but I'm talking about hallucinations that are as vivid as so-called reality. So then what's reality? To be able to just continue to observe with consistency, you equanimously observe whatever phenomena. Your whole body may fill with bliss and light upon occasion. And just be aware, a little more bliss on the right side, a little less bliss on the left, OK? Changing this way, changing that way, just like you'd be aware of the breath. Then the purification will continue. You may also get some unusually unpleasant experiences. I already described these icky sticky feelings, these vulnerable feelings, feelings like you don't have any skin left on your body, feelings like bugs are crawling through your veins. You just want to jump out of your skin, your body shakes, you go through all sorts of weird movements and sounds. If those kinds of unpleasant experiences happen to you, simply consistently observe them with precision and allowing. And then the process of purification will continue. If somewhere along the line an experience is very pleasant or very unpleasant or very startling or very boring and you forget to observe with mindfulness and equanimity, then the process of purification stops for a while. So no matter what comes up, if fear comes up, it's entirely possible that as you go into deeper states and you begin to approach real liberation experiences, as you come right to the door of liberation, you'll encounter the fence that separates the personal from the transpersonal, that separates the vulnerable from the invulnerable. And that fence has a name. It's called fear. Not fear of this or that, just the generic phenomenon, fear per se. And if you continue to observe the mind-body state of that fear, then you'll be able to bore through that fence and go over to the other side. But it won't be fear for any reason. It will just be fear. It will just be there for no reason whatsoever. You could be in the safest possible environment and have profound feelings of fear because you're close to an experience of going beyond the limited identity. So all along the path, from beginning to end, all a person does is apply these four principles. If you remember them, you'll always have the answer for what to do, at least insofar as vipassana goes. Now of course, are there other ways to become fully enlightened outside of vipassana? Absolutely. Is vipassana the best way? Not necessarily. Does it work? Yeah, it does work. That we can say. It certainly is a way. So everything that I present to you, of course, is within the structure of the vipassana way of working. When you work in other systems, these principles may or may not be applicable. Each system of liberation is self-contained. It's self-consistent. It has all the necessary and sufficient elements for doing the job, so to speak. So when I give these talks, please understand, everything we do here is within the context of vipassana. There are two other major Buddhist practices, Zen and Vajrayana, and outside of Buddhism, there are many practices that bring liberation. So these talks are just about one particular approach to the issue. And in this approach, from beginning to end, whatever comes up in your experience, you're mindful, you're equanimous, you understand that you don't expect to be able to do it perfectly, you just do your best in a relative way, and you keep on doing it no matter what. No matter what reactions take place to having done it. So as the result of something as seemingly innocuous as remaining alert, who could object? What's the remaining alert? Plugging the gaps in awareness. It seems to be innocuous, but it's not innocuous. It can initiate incredibly blissful experiences and incredibly uncomfortable experiences in the process of purification. So you consistently observe those experiences. If you remember these principles, then what will happen is, as the months and years pass, your understanding will deepen, understanding about fundamental issues, and the blockages to happiness will break up of their own, just naturally. At first slowly, but then as time goes on, it will accelerate dramatically. So in your tenth year of meditation, you grow as much in a week as you grew in your whole first year of meditation. And in your twentieth year of meditation, you feel every day you're literally a new self. It's like you're literally born. You get to live as many lives as there are days in the year. You're just born in the world anew every morning. Every day is very, very big. So this is sort of the long sweep of the practice. As the process of purification or catharsis is going on, your subjective experiences as you sit and meditate are going to vary. Sometimes it's going to be very easy to meditate. You'll sit down, the mind will be concentrated, the body will be full of pleasant vibrations, and it seems like you could sit there forever. Other times when you sit down, you'll have the opposite experience. The mind will be very scattered and the body will feel very antsy and it's like torture to sit there for even five minutes. What's important to remember is as long as you're applying those four principles, you're moving forward insofar as, and you cannot move backwards, insofar as the ultimate goal of this practice. However, since the blockages are sort of like fossils and they exist at deeper and deeper geological strata within consciousness, depending on the rhythm of release of these blockages, by blockages I mean basically the holding patterns from our past experience, what we call in Buddhism, sankharas. Something like, I guess, what they would call complexes or knots in psychotherapy. According to the rhythm of the release of these blockages, your subjective experience will sometimes be hard, sometimes be easy. But the release is always taking place as long as you consistently, as best you can, try to be mindful and allowing. There will be a tendency, however, when a layer of blockage has come to the surface and been evaporated through the clear light of observation and you feel good subjectively. There's a tendency to feel at that time, oh, I'm making progress. This practice is for me. This is great. And that will go on for a certain period of time until the next deeper level of blockage shakes loose and starts to percolate up to the surface. At that time, as I say, the mind will scatter and the body will feel yucky and there'll be a tendency to think, what am I doing wrong? I felt so great before. Last month I felt so great and I could concentrate. Now it's like I never meditated before. Why am I going backwards? What have I done wrong? But you haven't gone backwards. Deeper material has percolated upwards and will continue to percolate upwards for many, many years and indeed decades. So as far as the subjective experience goes, it's going to be hard, it's going to be easy, it's going to be hard, it's going to be easy, it's going to be hard, it's going to be easy. What you learn after a few years is not to evaluate your practice in terms of whether you feel like sitting or don't feel like sitting or whether you have pleasant experiences as you sit or whether it's a struggle to sit. You learn not to evaluate the practice that way. Then how to evaluate the practice? The second best way to evaluate the practice is to observe the spontaneous, permanent improvements in your relationships with human beings. Just the effects in ordinary life. That's the second best way. You'll notice that even when your subjective experiences on the cushion may not be all that pleasant, the changes are still taking place in daily life. The very best way to evaluate your practice, however, is to not evaluate it at all. To simply do it. The same way you simply breathe. It's just part of life. So over the course of the months and years of your life, if you do a little bit of sitting each day and do something like this with regularity several times a year, you will work through layer after layer of blockage. And your understandings about the really important fundamental issues will deepen and deepen. The insight is a many-faceted jewel. And different teachers emphasize different facets, different sides of that jewel. So sometimes people get very confused. They don't realize it's one jewel, one wisdom. Early Buddhism put a great emphasis on that aspect of insight called knowing how not to suffer. Is it important? What do you think? Just wait till the next time you suffer in some teeny little way. It won't even have to be major. Just some little thing, some little frustration. You'll see how important it is. But that's not the only facet to insight. There's a whole other aspect which was not talked about much in early Buddhism, but is very much emphasized in Zen Buddhism, which is this whole aspect of experiencing oneness with things, merging, being able to extend your identity to include the objects that you look at, the people that you interact with, etc. Another aspect of insight or spiritual wisdom that's very much emphasized in the third tradition of Buddhism, the Vajrayana, is the understanding of how the flow of consciousness creates appearances. Actually, how it is, the process by which the vibration of consciousness forms things. And in the Vajrayana tradition, they call it visualization, but it's much, much more than that. What you actually do is learn how to participate in the activity of consciousness that manifests things. You understand how it is that appearances well up out of nothing. This, of course, seems very irrelevant to people when they begin their practice, but this is sort of like post-graduate stuff. When you begin your practice, you're very much concerned with the ABCs, which is natural. Just the basics, how can I get a little more concentration, how can I get a little more patience, a little peace of mind. But after many, many years of meditation, you become interested in other kinds of topics that become utterly fascinating. The sequence of events that are happening every millisecond, every microsecond, that lead from the void to appearances. The appearance of the room, the appearance of the people. I know we tend to think there is a thing called a room here. There are things called people here. But there's a whole other way of experiencing that. Eventually, one gets insight and one actually sees, moment by moment, how it is that nothing is able to create something. It's what in the Jewish mystical tradition is called Briha Yesh Ma'en in Hebrew, the continuous creation of something from nothing, which is taken as the highest realization in the Jewish mystical tradition. In other words, somebody once asked Einstein, if he could have his druthers, if he could have exactly what he wanted, what would he want? He said, I'm paraphrasing, but in essence, if I could know, if I was given any knowledge that I could have any knowledge, what I would really like to know and what I've sought all these decades in my science is I want to know how God creates the world. What's God's process in creating the world? I'm paraphrasing, but in essence, that's what he said. In saying that, whether he was aware of it or not, and I'm not sure he was even consciously aware of it, of course, he was drawing directly on his Jewish spiritual roots. Because the Jewish mystical tradition is not so interested in union with God. Jewish mystical tradition is interested in actually figuring out how God works. Sort of figures, right? Interestingly enough, so is the Buddhist tradition, although they don't use the word God. We don't use the word God, but we do use the word, the source. The source in the Buddhist tradition is described exactly the same way that the source in the Jewish tradition is described. And there has been, as far as I know, no contact until very recently between these traditions. So when Isaac Luria in Palestine in the 16th century described expansion and contraction and continuous creation, there is no reason to think that he had any contact with Buddhist meditators or people like that who describe the activity of impermanence as expanding, contracting, and molding our experience moment by moment. So you pass through a sequence of insights and it culminates in an actual moment by moment perception of how God works, to use a very un-Buddhist phrase. Then you're never bored anymore. That I can promise you. You may have heard of Bodhidharma, that according to legend he sat looking at a wall for nine years. How can anybody look at a wall for nine years? Well, he wasn't looking at an object called the wall, assuming this legend is true. He was looking at the source creating that wall moment by moment, moment by moment. And a person would no longer get bored looking at the wall than God gets bored creating it, if you were able to perceive that. So you pass through a sequence of insights, starting with things that anybody can understand, like how to experience pain without suffering, and culminating in things that maybe sound pretty weird to people, like how does the self and the world arise out of nothingness every moment? And where does that culminate in? What's the purpose of all of that? Is that the end of the path? You become a liberated person, you're never bored anymore, you can dance with the source, you don't have to worry so much about suffering. Is that the end of the path? Actually, no. Just as concentration is the primary tool that allows a person to attain these insights and purifications, these insights and purifications are the tool that allows a person to do something else. And that something else is to function as an effortless source of benefit to the people around you. The important term here is effortless. If we try to be good and loving people, to be richly warm and human people, without having gone through the process of insight and purification, then it's like trying to put a beautiful paint job over the old paint without having cleaned off the old paint first. It won't take. It may look okay, but sooner or later the crud starts to ooze up through the appearance of the loving, compassionate human being. Anybody here speak Japanese? Jigane ga deru, they say in Japanese. It means, when you, the underlying material seeps through the paint. There's no exact English translation. So the trick is that the process of insight and purification naturally leads to the life of a kind of effortless service and loving kindness and compassion. And that's the ultimate goal of this practice. We can look upon how this naturally happens from two perspectives. One, remember I said insight is a many faceted jewel and one side of it, one facet, is a knowledge of oneness. So you begin to look upon your world as yourself, quite tangibly, quite literally. And you experience the people that come in front of you as actually being you, in some very real sense. So it's only natural that the continuity, if you are to continue your practice, if you start out with your practice and the goal is liberation for yourself and as the result of continuing that practice, the definition of yourself now changes to encompass the world, then if you wish to continue with liberating yourself, you have to make some contribution to liberating the world. What form will that contribution take? Many, many possible forms. Many possible forms, depending on what? Depending on the culture you live in, depending on your preconceptions, depending on your personality, depending on your ability, depending on your interests and proclivities. But in some way there will be a reaching out. It can range from social activism to being a meditation teacher to being a wizard, cultivating the special powers of the mind, psychic powers, to living an ordinary life but subtly pervading each person you meet with a quality of loving kindness that they may not even be aware of. So some of the ways that we benefit or help the world around us as an extension of our own liberation are sort of on the surface and obvious. You build a hospital or you work to change society or save the environment in some way. But some of the ways that we work are subtle. The nice thing about the subtle ways is we can always do them. We may or may not be able to be successful with changing things in the grosser material world. But we can always, literally all our waking hours, be pervading our environment with subtle positive influences. There are several ways that this can be done. I'll describe them to you. One is a practice that we call metta or loving kindness. A second one is a practice called karana or compassion. I said that there were two ways we could benefit. One is by, or two ways that the practice naturally leads from liberation to benefiting. One is by that realization of oneness. The other is going to be perhaps a little bit hard for you to understand at this time, but it will become very evident as the months and years of your practice goes on. The result of the vipassana practice is that you realize that all experience is made up of atomic vibrations. Once you realize that, you can, this is a little hard to describe to people, you might say that your experience becomes clarified, it becomes transparent. Yes, that's one way to look at it. You come to realize that the actual substance of experience, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body and the thinking mind, the actual substance of experience becomes transparent and elastic. Most people, their experience is very opaque. Doesn't it seem opaque? The walls seem very solid, very opaque. You don't feel like you can look through them. The self seems very opaque, the body is very opaque, and it doesn't seem elastic and vibratory. This room does not seem, for most people, elastic and vibratory. But as you go through the process of insight and purification, your experience becomes clear and elastic. So it can resonate like a bell. That's the elasticity. And it can take on any color you want. When something is transparent, you can easily color it any way you want. So, in the practice of the loving kindness and compassion, we first experience the mind-body process as being transparent and elastic. And then we started vibrating with a vibration of compassion and loving kindness. And we color it with a little drop of coloration of compassion and loving kindness. And because it's elastic, all we have to do is put that little vibration on, and it just continues to vibrate effortlessly all day, loving kindness. And because our experience has become literally clarified, all we have to do is put one little drop of friendliness in it, and just like a drop of food coloring spreads in a tumbler of water, the whole mind-body process is just filled with boundless friendliness and compassion. So there's a natural link between the purification process and vipassana, which literally transforms the substance of our being so that it can effortlessly take on the vibration and color of being fully human in the best of what it means to be a human being. That's where this path culminates. That's what it's all about. So you might say that there are, actually, in traditional Buddhism, they had four things that they did. When they started people out, people didn't have any concentration, but at least they could give to support the monks. And it's still true today. If you go to Southeast Asia, people may not have the time to develop concentration power and things like that, but they'll always, everybody has the wherewithal to put one spoon of curry into the monk or nun's bowl. And that's called dana, or giving. If you can give, then you can also go beyond, that becomes a basis of making merit, and then you can go beyond just giving and you can develop concentration. So the purpose of giving is to put yourself in, set up a certain frame of mind so that you feel good about yourself, you've helped another, and now you can sit down and the mind is calm and you can become concentrated. The purpose of developing concentration, it's not an end to itself. It's a tool that will allow you to purify and gain insight and become free. But that's not an end to itself either. When you become free, the entire substance of your being has become transparent and elastic. Now you can be anything you want. And the thing that you want to be, of course, is a good human being. And so you learn how to literally resonate out into your world this friendliness and this compassion. Not that you necessarily go through life with a smile at every single thing, but the pores of your being are always smiling. And that subtle, those thousands of subtle smiles that come out of your skin, they have a cumulative influence on the people that you interact with. And that's how you give. You give yourself back to the world. So it sort of goes full circle. You begin with this practice of dhana, or giving, in a material sense. And then that leads to samadhi, or concentration. Samadhi leads to prajna, or wisdom. And prajna leads to another kind of dhana, another kind of giving. But in this case, it's a giving of your entire being. That is the broad sweep of what this path is about. Any questions? Question was asked, what is my definition of addiction? I use the three words addiction, compulsion, and drivenness as being synonymous. They're the same thing as far as I'm concerned. Is there a particular addiction or compulsion you're interested in? Yeah. I just use those words synonymously. The mechanism that I like to, the model I should say for addictive mechanism that I like to use is, well let's say a person has a substance abuse addiction. So they say I have a problem with alcohol. Okay, but let's look a little bit deeper at that. Do you really have a problem with the substance called alcohol? Or is the problem that when you don't have alcohol you feel uncomfortable and in order to cope with that discomfort you take the alcohol? Of course it's the latter. It has nothing to do with the substance. It's the fact that without the substance the person feels discomfort and they have no other coping mechanism for it other than to use the alcohol. But is the issue really the discomfort? I would say looked at a little deeper, the issue is that the person feels discomfort and doesn't have the tools to experience that discomfort without suffering. They don't know how to observe it. They don't know how to let it spread. They don't know how to be aware of its impermanence. So that ultimately the problem is an issue of not having skill at feeling. So on the surface it seems that they have a problem with a substance called alcohol. Looked at a little deeper we can say they have a problem with certain kinds of discomfort. But looked at deeper still, the issue is they don't have a skill at how to experience that discomfort without suffering. So it goes back to the work we do here on the cushion. Does that make sense? If a person has a compulsive disorder and works in our meditation program, we usually recommend that in addition to the practice of the meditation they get some sort of behaviorally oriented external support system. If not a 12-step program then some sort of counselor or something that is working at the level of behavior. If a person maintains their abstinence but does not develop the skill with the unpleasant sensations associated with the abstinence, they can go their whole life that way. They'll avoid the gross suffering caused by the addiction, but they'll never come to grips with the subtle suffering, I mean really come to grips with the subtle suffering that underlies that compulsion. So they don't have an effortless abstinence. But if a person is able to feel through, I like that phrase, you know, we usually think about I gotta talk it through, I gotta think it through, I gotta act it out. Well all of those have their place, but there's a whole other human endeavor. It's what you're learning here when you sit through those discomforts that you've been having. You're learning how to feel something through, deal with it feeling at the level of feeling. If the person learns how to feel through the sensations that were driving the behavior, then they'll have an effortless abstinence. They will become recovered alcoholics. That of course goes against what they tell you in the 12-step programs. In the 12-step programs they tell you you're always recovering, you're never recovered. And there's a good reason for that, because most people don't recover. And most people will fool themselves thinking they do recover. Recovered means that you have felt through all that poison and pain. And that's something that you could do without meditation, but it would be hard. It could happen without meditation, just naturally. But meditation will make it more likely to happen, especially Vipassana meditation. So there are two aspects to recovering. One is you have to abstain, otherwise the sensations won't come to the surface. The other though is if you want to really recover, you have to feel through those sensations until they're not in the way anymore. They don't drive and distort behavior anymore. Of course when you work through the driver sensations behind a major compulsion, you will have also worked through most of the driver sensations in your life. Your whole life will change. That's why Shelly's whole life changed over the years of working through her eating compulsion. Everything changed. So unless a person is abstinent, at least to a certain degree, they won't be able to get the feelings to the surface to work with. That's one reason why it's good to be in a behaviorally oriented therapy in addition to doing meditation. But there's another reason if you meditate why it's not always the case, but often, why we would suggest that they do do something like a 12-step. Can you guess what it is? Why we would want people to have some sort of behaviorally oriented controlling force on them if they were meditating on these feelings? Well, what's going to happen is before a bubble bursts, it has to reach optimal size. And when you work with the sensations, meditation represents the opposite coping mechanism of addiction. Pain comes up. The substance is a coping mechanism. It anesthetizes the pain, makes it go away. And you can cope, sort of. Of course, it brings much greater pain because of the force of the abuse of the substance in your life. But it does give you a kind of coping mechanism, a coping mechanism called go unconscious. Meditation offers an alternate coping mechanism, but unfortunately, it happens to be the exact opposite coping mechanism. Go conscious, fully conscious. Therefore, in switching from the old coping mechanism to the new coping mechanism, one is bound to pass through an awkward intermediate zone where the old coping mechanism is being let go of, but the new coping mechanism is not in place anymore, or in place yet, I should say. At that time, there's going to be a very strong tendency to act out those feelings. And unless there's a behaviorally oriented program, you might find as the result of the meditation that the compulsions get worse for a little while before they break up. Because the sensations are now being allowed to come to the surface. They're not being stuffed down. And it's those sensations that you've been drinking over, or eating over, or smoking over, or beating your wife over, or gambling over. So that's another reason why, in my experience, it does best to combine behaviorally oriented therapies with the meditation if you have a real compulsive disorder. Not if you're just driven, you know, the usual neurotic kinds of things that we all have. You don't have to go into a 12-step program. But if it's a disorder, if it's the center of your life, you know if you have a compulsive disorder. I mean, it's very evident. I usually recommend the double approach. The surface approach of controlling the behavior through therapy and the really deep approach of the meditation to bring the sensations to the surface. Perhaps Shelly will talk during this retreat about some of the things that she went through, the kinds of experiences she went through, to root out those sensations. Yes? Along the same line, I think the issue came up for me right before I went into this whole drivenness. I was getting really impatient. When are we going to get up and get on to the next thing? That's that inflation. The bubble's getting big, but it's going to pop. It'll pop. Just stay with it. So I was wondering, where do you think that comes from? Is that similar to substance abuse? Substance abuse is merely an extreme case of the ordinary human condition. Period. It's as simple as that. It's just an extreme case of what we all do. So everybody is a compulsive. Everybody is an addict, unless they've realized nirvana. Nirvana means extinction of compulsion. Now, does that mean that you... That's what it means. Literally. That's literally what it means. Well, when you extinguish compulsion, does that mean that you become inert? When a person works through an eating compulsion, do they stop eating? No. For the first time, they really appreciate their food. When a person works out all the drives in their life, including the drive to understand, the drive to breathe, the drive to move the body ever, we're talking deep. It doesn't mean that then you stop thinking, you stop moving, you stop eating, you stop breathing. It means that for the first time, you're able to really think clearly and really breathe fully and really move effortlessly. So everybody is a compulsive, and the goal of Buddhist practice is to eliminate all compulsion. So we can dine on life instead of scarfing it down. If a person with an eating disorder can work through all the things that drive them and then continue back to a normal eater, is it your opinion then that an addict or an alcoholic can go back to drinking or drugging? I don't know the answer to that question, but it's an interesting theoretical question. There are so few addicts that have achieved nirvana that we don't have a large population to test this hypothesis on. However, I would say theoretically, it would be possible. It seems like it should be possible. Maybe I should start smoking marijuana again and see if I get hooked again. I don't think I've gone deep enough in meditation to take the chance. You people are asking the really good questions. You're a great audience. If you didn't hear, the question is, how does the practice affect the way you pick up or the way you respond to other people's negativity? This is fascinating. This is a fascinating area. This is where we get the difference between psychotherapy and meditation. Both have their important realms, their realm of application. One of the things that a lot of psychotherapists do is teach, or a big part of their job as they conceive of it, and it's quite a legitimate job, an important job, is to teach people what's coming from them and what's coming from the outside. Because people tend to pick up on other people's negativity and then think it's their own, or they tend to project their negativity out into others. In psychotherapy, it's important to teach people to make a distinction between their negativities and other people's negativities. And to have a healthy personality, that's true, that's necessary. But in the spiritual path, we're dealing with a deeper level and it's exactly the opposite. It doesn't make any difference whether the discomfort arises from you or is imposed upon you by the people you're with. As long as you greet it with skill, your consciousness will be purified. Does that make sense? So what happens as the result of this practice is that when you're around negative people, basically what that means is you feel their pain. If you pluck a guitar string and have another guitar near it, the second guitar will do what's called a sympathetic resonance. It will pick up the vibration of the first guitar. If you're around a person that is in physical or emotional pain, your body, as the result of this practice, will become like an antenna and it will pick it up. But as a result of this practice, you will have skill at feeling. And therefore, you will bring the qualities of attention and allowing to those resonances that you pick up from the other person. Therefore, you will feel that your consciousness is being purified and you are being empowered by the skillful way that you are experiencing the discomfort that is being imposed upon you by the other person. Now that's a mouthful. Let me repeat it. It's sort of like E equals MC squared. Would you repeat that again, Dr. Einstein? That was a mouthful. Okay, that was a lot there. When you have developed skill at feeling and you pick up the discomforts that other people are feeling, you will be able to apply your skill at feeling to those just as though they had come from yourself. And therefore, you will be able to purify and empower your consciousness by the skillful way that you experience the discomforts imposed upon you by being in the presence of people that are in pain. Does that make sense? Now what happens as the result of this, of spiritual practices, I often have people come to me and they'll say something like this. I've been doing this or that spiritual practice and it could be something as ordinary as a special diet or something like that. But I've been doing this practice and it's made me very sensitive. And I pick up all this negative energy that I never picked up before. What should I do? Or the other thing that people say is, I pick up the negativities of others and it drains my energy. These are the two things I hear a lot from people involved in spiritual growth and different kinds of trainings and things like that. If you find yourself thinking people are draining my energy because I pick up so much now or thinking that I'm suffering because I'm so sensitive, that means that that is a symptom of the awkward intermediate zone. Remember I said that there's an awkward intermediate zone between the old coping mechanism and the new coping mechanism? The old coping mechanism is tighten up and turn away. The new coping mechanism is open up and turn towards. In between is an awkward world where you're neither fish nor fowl. So when people practice the spiritual path and they say that they're picking up these negativities and things like that, it means they haven't gone far enough. You have to become infinitely vulnerable before you become invulnerable in a healthy way, absolutely invulnerable. So when you're around others, the deeper you go in the meditation, the more you'll pick up the pain of others. But the more you'll have a skill that will allow you to use that imposed pain for your own growth. Now there's something else though that happens. This path is not just about our own growth. It's about helping others. Helping others takes place at various levels. There's the surface level, you can help others. Somebody needs to move, you help them pack. Somebody needs money, you lend them money, things like that. But there's a subtle way that we help others. Let's say that you're in the presence of a person that's in pain. Maybe they're in the pain called anger. Maybe they're in the pain called sorrow. Maybe they're in the pain called a broken leg. You're in their presence and you feel their pain. And you feel it in your body. You're precise about it. You're equanimous with it. You let it spread and move. Therefore, it doesn't turn into suffering. In fact, it turns into purification and empowerment inside of you. But something else is happening. You're in the presence of that person. That person is suffering because they're feeling those sensations without precision, without equanimity, without a knowledge of the impermanence of those sensations. Therefore, the sensations are arising strongly in their body, being unskillfully experienced and causing suffering. The same sensations are arising subtly in your body by induction. They're being induced into your body subtly. You're experiencing them skillfully and you're experiencing a freedom from suffering within yourself. The presence of your body skillfully experiencing their pain will eventually begin to entrain and induce in their body the skills that you have. So by skillfully experiencing the other person's pain, you will subtly be helping that person to do the same. Even if you never talk about it, just the way you carry yourself, maybe even just the smell of your body, will subliminally retrain that person with time to be more skillful with their pain. So you're helping them too. So you reach a point in this practice where you don't care whether the pain comes from yourself or comes from another. It makes no difference at all. You relate to it in exactly the same way. And you are working a subtle magic on your world constantly. People don't know it consciously, but you can detect the subtle way that you influence each person you interact with, even the casual interaction of the person you get your airline ticket from or the person that you sit next to in the bus. You know that you are influencing them in a subtle way. You can feel it and it's very satisfying. The question is, if you didn't hear, sometimes when I'm there and there's a pain, I'll notice that it will sort of break up. And does that have something to do with being in the moment? Is that correct? Is that your question? Yes. The answer to your question is a very simple yes. If you go into the pain, if you are present moment by moment with the pain, then the pain won't cause you suffering. Why is that? Well, this gets into another discussion. I'll try to cut it down. Basically, I can put it into another one of these sentences that's a mouthful. You become so engaged in the activity of experiencing the pain that you have no time left to solidify the pain into a thing that is an object that's in the way. Does that make sense? You're too present in the activity of consciousness to congeal consciousness into a thing called pain. That's when you get completely into it, it simply becomes a movement or an activity. There are two spatial metaphors that people use for the witness consciousness. And they both have a certain point to them, although they're exactly opposite. But they refer to the same experience. If you want to use the distancing metaphor, the pain's here and you distance yourself, you disassociate, you don't identify with it. That's one metaphor. But however, it could just as easily be described as the exact opposite. The pain's there and you collapse the distance between you and it. And therefore there's a transcendence of suffering. Use whichever metaphor works for you. Both are inaccurate in the end. Because ultimately you have to go beyond the concept of being inside space. You have to replace the concept of being inside space with the concept of being the source of space. That's a biggie. That's not going to come for most of you in your first retreat. Or your fifth retreat. Or your tenth retreat. But somewhere along the line. But in any event, either of those is okay. Whichever one helps you. If you get helped by the idea I'm going to distance myself and I'm a witness back here looking down at it there and it can't get me, fine. For now, look at it that way. On the other hand, if the idea of I'm going to so get into it and collapse the distance that I become it and it can't get me, if that metaphor works for you, fine. Well, there's an awful lot of hands up. I'm glad you're stimulated. Yes? Scholars of both science and mysticism use the terms objective reality, subjective reality and objective reality, imprecisely. When you say the object of meditation, is there a relationship between the object of your meditation and objective reality? No. Yes, words are ambiguous. The object of meditation means that subset of experience that you are defining as the domain that you're trying to be continuous with. In other words, experience is very complex. Moment by moment flow of experience. We will usually partition off a smaller piece of experience and define it as the object of meditation. What that means is that with respect to the defined object of meditation, we're trying to develop continuous clarity. And with respect to the rest of experience, we don't care. We're indifferent. So if your defined object of meditation is the breath, the physical sensation of breath, then you ignore all other physical sensations. But you do try to have continuous clarity with respect to that object of meditation. So object in this case means object in the sense of what you're aiming awareness at. Not object in the sense of objective reality versus subject reality. Basically, as far as I'm concerned, meditation is a science of subjective reality only. I personally would not make any claims about the objective world. That's the domain of other specialists, scientists and philosophers. I'm not a scientist. I'm not a philosopher. But I am a meditation teacher. And meditation is a science of the subjective world. In other words, it is a science, but it is a science that tells us things that are true and useful about the operation of these six senses, which is our objective world. There is a distinctive good feeling that comes when you release the psychological toxins. When you feel those letting go. It has a good feeling to it. I can't describe what that feeling is, except in a vague way. It's like you're getting cleaned out. It's like you're getting light. You're getting clear. You feel your potential for future suffering going down. You feel your potential for satisfaction going up. You feel empowerment, invulnerability. These kinds of feelings are the feelings that come up when you experience pain in a skillful way. Mostly if a person sits, forget about nine days, just try nine hours. Sit nine hours without moving the body, you pretty much have a consistent experience of discomforts arising in the body. But if each, literally thousands and thousands of waves of discomfort as you sit there. If each one of those waves is experienced distinctly without resistance, then that wave is felt to be like a massage. It's like nurturing. I know it's so counterintuitive against intuition. How can pain be nurturing? Most people have never had an experience like that. That person feels literally nurtured by the skillful way they experience that pain. And that nurturing is happening with each wave of pain. So it's happening every second. And that's what keeps them going, second by second by second by second. I don't know if that's, this is one of those dealies you just have to experience yourself. On the other hand, you can have the same purification by just fully experiencing that smile that you just had. You don't have to work with pain. You can work with pleasure too. The issue is the skill, not the intensity of pleasure or pain. So if you are fully present each time you smile for the rest of your life, you'll get the same enlightenment as the person that sat for nine days without moving. By the way, however, the way you'll know that that's true and that you're not fooling yourself is you'll be able to sit for nine days without moving. Oh, there's so many hands. Yes. How does, I can't phrase this very well, how would dealing with anger that wells up about some things in meditation, why would one try to heal that so it seems like it would get worse and worse and worse? That's a very important point. Before you feel anything through, it gets worse. Anything at all. That's the price we have to pay to become free people. Most people are not willing to pay that price, but it's a very small price. Remember I said the bubble is, somebody was saying something, I said the bubble is getting bigger, okay, but it eventually will pop. There's a metaphor I like to use, I suppose it's kind of gross as a metaphor, but it's pretty accurate. I remember when I was a kid, one of the worst freak outs I went through, and I was a very easily freaked out kid, okay. I did not have very much equanimity. I was a real whiny, petulant, difficult kid. I know this from memory and also from what people have told me. And I was like, I'd vomit at the drop of a hat. I mean, I just like, you know, I freaked out real easy. And I can remember one of the biggest freak outs, I mean I was having conniptions. I got a big boil on my arm, and my mother took me to a doctor. And you know, the boil hurt to begin with, right. And I get to the doctor, and he brings out this scalpel, okay. And he starts to cut into the boil, and I really lost it, okay. But it was a justified procedure. That boil had to be lanced. It was an act of compassion on the part of my mother to take me. Otherwise, those poisons would have just stayed in there for months and months and months and months. But at the moment when the boil is punctured, there is a moment of extreme pain. But then there's a lifetime of relief. And there is the freedom from the toxins. This may not sound like a very good advertisement for Vipassana meditation. But Vipassana meditation is the scalpel that lances the boil on the human soul. Okay. And you may have to pass, yes, the anger is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, okay, for a time. But it will break. And then you'll be free from it for the rest of your life. You won't have to carry around that poison and pain anymore. What most people would prefer to do is to try to paliate, that is to say to just bandage it over and ignore it somehow. But you're always going to be bumping the boil, no matter how thick the bandage is you put around. And the poison is always going to be there, subtly damaging you. And no matter how thick a bandage you may put on that boil, you're always going to knock it against this or that and it's going to hurt. So a wise and compassionate person says, okay, lancing the boil is going to be a pain for 30 seconds and a lifetime of relief. It's a small price to pay. The cumulative suffering that you go through if you don't lance the boil, if you sum up, if you take the integral, if you've had calculus of all the suffering you'll go through if you don't lance the boil, is thousands of times larger than that 30 seconds of intense pain. But the 30 seconds of intense pain you have to take on voluntarily. And then you're free. So any negative emotion is going to inflate before it pops. And this is the little price that we have to pay to become free people. And so what does it mean to be an experienced meditator? It means that you pop layer after layer after layer like that as you're sitting there. Something comes up and you let it get as big as it can get and it bursts. And then the next thing comes up and you let it get as big as it can get and it bursts. So that you're doing that not just once but dozens of times in a single sitting. That's called real catharsis, real purification. Does that make sense of what I'm saying? So yes, it's going to get bigger. The physical pains are going to get bigger. Your sensitivity is going to get bigger. It's going to feel like you don't, at some point in your practice, maybe not at your first retreat, but at some point in your practice, it's going to feel like you don't even have skin left on your body, you're so sensitive. And you're just going to watch that with equanimity. And on the other side of that is a kind of absolute unflappability, an absolute invulnerability that you cannot be shaken where the average person, the average well-adjusted person, the unusually strong human being would freak out. But you've got something that is beyond human strength. And it's a very small price to pay. But you gradually work up to it. You don't have to do it in your first retreat. But as you get experience and skill, you'll get confidence that maybe it's okay to let these things just expand and not do anything about them. Shirley, did you want to add something to that? Yeah, I was just going to say, I can either say it or you can elaborate. Just from personal experience, I think in that interim, before you're able to have total equanimity, from my own experience and also the experience of people that I've taught, and also from a psychological point of view, I think what rides you through that interim is at least through talks, through understanding, through encouragement, your understanding not to act things out. So even though you may not have total equanimity while the anger is expanding and the internal pain gets worse, the quality of your life, because it's a process, is starting to improve even though you don't have equanimity because you at least have the awareness to observe the anger rather than to act it out. So you start feeling better about yourself even after a year or so of practicing. So it starts to build. It isn't like you don't have it and then all of a sudden you have it. It's like you start to get excited and enthused about what's happening to yourself. You can feel the difference, even like Shintan said, even after a couple of days, but particularly after a few months of practice, you notice you're not reacting as much and you're taking more responsibility. And it's a really valid point to take home with you that we're not taught how to feel things out. As a psychotherapist, it always frustrated me to tell my clients to feel things through, that there really wasn't a technique that I knew could take them to the point of feeling them through to the point that this does. So it's like we all know, it's a primitive knowing that it's better to feel things through than to act them out, but we act them out out of frustration. So when you stop acting them out, that high is what carries you through until you have to never do it.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.84, "text": " I wanted to talk this evening about a few topics.
