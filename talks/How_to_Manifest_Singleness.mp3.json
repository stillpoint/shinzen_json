{"text": " Yen Lu, did you bring this? Puti damo, da shi. Did you bring this? Oh wow, thank you. Do you all know the story? Some of you do, some of you don't. This is a really big one too. Where did you get it? Little Tokyo? Or Tokyo, Japan? Oh wow, big Tokyo. Yeah, it's a cool one, alright. When Buddhism came into China, which was during the Han Dynasty, the Han Dynasty roughly corresponds to the Roman Empire period, so about 2,000 years ago. Buddhism came in the form of Indian Mahayana and it traveled over what was called the Silk Road. Have you ever heard of the Silk Road? It's the trade routes that linked China to India and then it continued on and ultimately linked China to the Western world. Roman emperors wore Chinese silk. The Chinese had a monopoly on silk, only they knew the secret of how to cultivate the silkworm and what to do with the silk. They kept that a national secret until very late, maybe the 18th century, something like that. So there were trade routes that were established because the whole world wanted this mysterious product that only China could produce and those trade routes were called the Silk Road. But what was cool is once the Silk Road was established, not only could Chinese silk go to the West, but a product of the West could go to China. Of course, from the Chinese perspective, India is part of the West. Buddhist missionaries came from India along those trade routes and over a period of many centuries introduced the foreign religion, the Western religion from the Chinese perspective, of Buddhism into China. Initially, Buddhism was looked upon by the Confucian establishment of China, oh, I guess about the same way that Episcopalians would look at Hare Krishnas. Just a real kooky foreign cult. And it was, from the Chinese point of view, a kooky foreign cult with belief systems that were, some of which did not mesh at all with Chinese culture. For example, according to traditional Chinese culture, the worst thing you could possibly do is not have children. Because if you didn't have children, the ancestor veneration could not be carried on. So it would be an insult to all of your ancestors not to carry on the family ancestral rites. And Buddhism had this idea that celibacy was great. Also, China was a highly organized central government. And Buddhism had the idea that when you become a Buddhist monk or a nun, you owe loyalty to no political power whatsoever. You're completely beyond the pale of the structure of society. Chinese had an idea that you should work, a work ethic. But the Sanskrit word for work is karma, which has certain negative connotations. For example, if you cultivate crops or whatever, you kill creatures that are in the soil. So Buddhist monks and nuns wouldn't want to make karma. They wouldn't get engaged in physical labor. So there were a lot of culture clashes, to say nothing of the weirdness of shaving your head and wearing orange colored clothes and whatever. But over a period of many hundreds of years, the Chinese gradually Sinified Buddhism, adapted it. And this came about after you started to have generations of native born Chinese enlightened masters who felt confident to modify the tradition. And so by the Sui and Tang dynasties, uniquely Chinese forms of Buddhism were evolving. That to a certain extent were able to overcome the antipathy of the two cultures and produce something that was really comfortable, a Chinese expression of Buddhist enlightenment. It's sort of interesting, of course, in olden times, it takes a long time, centuries and centuries. But in one generation we've already modified Buddhism in the West as much as it took 500 years in China. But of course, that's the difference in the pace. So the Buddhist world consists of three culture spheres. A very early form of Buddhism is preserved in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka, Laos, Cambodia, called Theravada Buddhism, you may know. It's basically a continuation of Indic forms, but the early forms of Buddhism. And the Vipassana practice that we do is associated with that school of Buddhism. Then the latest form of Indian Buddhism is known by various names, Vajrayana, Tantric Buddhism, Mantrayana, Esoteric Buddhism, Lamaism is a word that's sometimes used. And that form is primarily preserved in Tibet. Both Tibetan civilization and Southeast Asian civilization have at their core Buddhist Indic culture. But Chinese Buddhism, East Asian Buddhism is a very different critter. Because by the time Buddhism reached China, China already had 2,000 years of their own culture, their own literature, their own ways of doing things. The people in Southeast Asia were essentially tribal when Buddhism came in. The people in Tibet were essentially tribal in the 7th, 8th century. In fact, fairly ferociously tribal. So in those two Buddhist culture spheres, the Indic forms, even the language, had a profound impact in creating the cultures of Southeast Asia and in Tibet. But in China, Buddhism was just one little add-on to an already existing rich culture that already had some of its own paths to enlightenment, for example, Taoism. So the most famous of the Chinese schools that sort of arose as a hybrid or mixed breed, the mestizo spirituality from Chinese culture in general and Taoism in specific, and Indian Mahayana, the most famous school, of course, is called what? Chan in Chinese, Zen in Japanese, Sun in Korean, and Tian in Vietnamese. So Japan, Korea, Vietnam, they get their Buddhism not directly from India, the way Thailand or Tibet did, but in that Sinified, that Chinese modified form. So that all relates to this dahl here, which the Japanese call daruma. Can you guess what Sanskrit word that corresponds to? Daruma. Sounds like dharma, of course. Actually, it's an abbreviation of Bodhi Daruma, which in Sanskrit would be Bodhi Dharma. Bodhi is awakening, dharma is the dharma that I translate. Dharma is natural spiritual law. That's the way I like to interpret that word. And Bodhi Dharma, these dolls that the Japanese make, the Chinese call him Puti Damo. Okay, as you can see, that's the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of Bodhi Daruma, Puti Damo. Bodhi Dharma, these dolls that the Japanese make, represent Bodhi Dharma. And according to the histories, Bodhi Dharma was an Indian meditation master who came to China. He's considered to be the first in the lineage of patriarchs of the Chan or Zen school. But there's some interesting stories about him. You notice how he's portrayed without any arms or legs, just sort of globular manifestation. Well, of course, these stories are not to be taken literally. I sincerely doubt that this story has any validity at all, but it's an interesting story. Supposedly, he sat for nine years without getting up. So the rest of his body sort of atrophied. Like I say, I highly doubt that that is the case, but in any event, they sort of symbolize the fact that maybe you could sit there for nine years, okay, by this globular shape. And he was such an intense teacher that it is said that Chinese monks that studied with him couldn't, were not physically strong enough to endure the regimen he wanted them to follow. So he strengthened them by teaching them certain kinds of physical exercises. And that became the basis of Kung Fu, Chinese martial arts. So then maybe knowing that, you could guess what temple Bodhi Dharma lived in. You better believe it, the Shaolin Temple. He founded the famous Shaolin Temple, which to this day still teaches, of course, the martial arts. The reason I like to have these Bodhi Dharma dolls, though, is not so much because of the sort of cultural aspect, but there's a deep symbolism about the whole nature of the endeavor that we do when we meditate. The doll is very light. It's made out of paper mache, but it's weighted in the bottom. No matter how many times you knock it over, it comes right back up. A lot of times they'll have written on them, Nana Korobi Yao Ki. It means, fall down seven times, get up eight. Or fall down 70 times, get up 71. Or fall down a million times, get up a million and one. That is the essence of this practice. The mind wanders once, you bring it back. It wanders seven times, you bring it back. It wanders 7,000 times, you bring it back. You try to meditate, you can't do it, you try again. And you try, and you can't do it, and you try again. You just keep trying. You get knocked over a thousand times in this path. A thousand times. But unlike baseball, where it's three strikes and you're out, fortunately God keeps pitching. So we constantly get another chance at bat. Another chance at, okay, maybe I can be a little more mindful. Maybe I can have a little more equanimity. If you talk to the average Japanese person about Buddhism, they don't know very much. And they're probably sort of embarrassed that you'd even ask about it. Embarrassed that they don't know much. Yet, all those centuries of all of those monks and nuns and householders doing all of that meditation has profoundly influenced the psyche of the Japanese people. And that influence comes out in modern Japan in various ways that are quite positive. It is part of an ordinary Japanese education. Ordinary education, high school education, includes calculus. Now in the United States, you don't learn calculus usually until you get into college, and even then it's probably an engineering or math or science major. But you don't get out of high school in Japan without at least a little calculus. Well, do you think that those kids are that much smarter? I don't. I don't think it has anything to do with intelligence. I think it has to do with the Bodhidharma doll. You understand what I'm saying? I can remember vividly to this day my first algebra class in high school, and I can remember reading the first paragraph and not understanding it. And reading it again and not understanding it. And reading it again and not understanding it. And giving up. That's it. I'm not going to get this. The Japanese kid has the same experience, except is less likely to give up on the third time. He'll probably try again and again and again. So even though they may not know specifically this or that about Buddhism, the fact that they played with dolls like this that said seven times down, eight times up, that has an influence on how people go about things. And that is a direct influence from the Zen monastic training. I must have read my calculus book twenty times from beginning to end, until it fell apart. Until it finally started to sink in, oh yeah, I get this stuff. Yeah, this is very straightforward. This is obvious. But it sure wasn't obvious the first time I read it, or the tenth time I read it. So we're going to keep Bodhidharma up here to remind us of the essence of this practice. For sure we're going to fall down lots and lots of times. So thank you, Yanlu, for bringing Dambo Tashi. I'll show you something interesting. Why do they call it the Zen school? Well, the word Zen in Japanese, in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced Chan. And it's an abbreviation of Chana. So maybe you can guess what Chana stands for. What would you guess? Chana. It's a transliteration using two Chinese characters for the Pali or Sanskrit word. In Sanskrit it's Dhyana. That means high concentration. Apparently, originally it was not the name of a particular school. It just meant the practice of doing meditation, high concentration. And they would talk about Zuo Chan, which means to sit in a state of high concentration, which in Japanese is pronounced Zazen, but Mandarin Chinese, Zuo Chan. Remember I said that the Chan school developed, even though they claimed to have an Indian master as their first patriarch, the way it really developed is when native-born Chinese had done enough meditation that they felt confident to modify the Indic traditions that they had received. So apparently there was a group of people that were doing a lot of meditation. And people called them the meditators, the Chan people, the meditators. And it was just a generic term. And then because they were doing a lot of meditation, they had a lot of enlightenment and they got creative and they started to develop this whole Chinese approach to things. And the name stuck. And it became not a generic term for meditation, but the name of a particular school of Buddhism. The terms from Indian languages, Sanskrit primarily, or other Indic dialects, usually what the Chinese did is they would not transliterate. Occasionally they transliterated, but usually they translated. They tried to find a way to express the Sanskrit word in idiomatic Chinese, but they didn't really have a word for the deep states of dhyanic trance. That was a good word. So in this case they transliterated, but they did it in an interesting way. They chose a character that had the sound Chan, so it would match the sound. But it also contained an interesting meaning. Probably those of you who aren't Chinese, you don't know how to write Chinese, I guess by and large, but Chinese characters are not just arbitrary collections of strokes. They're built on very specific and very interesting structural principles. Basically there are two parts to the character. One of the parts gives you a general sense of the area that the character corresponds, how can I put it, gives you a general sense about the meaning of the character. And another part of the character is the phonetic, gives you a general sense of its sound. So there are 200 or so characters, it's sort of like a classification scheme of basic categories of objects or relationships. And those are called the radicals because they correspond to roots in Western languages. And then those radicals are put together with phonetics, and so when you see a Chinese character, you have some general idea of the domain that that character refers to, and you have a general idea of how it's pronounced, even if you've never seen the character before, you could probably figure out what it is. For example, one of the radicals, this is the sun radical, but originally it was written like that, which of course is a much more realistic representation of the sun. Or you can have the tree radical. In modern Chinese, it doesn't look too much like a tree. Maybe it looks a little like a tree. But in archaic Chinese, you could see the branches and the root very clearly. That's the tree radical. There's a bamboo radical. There's a human radical. Anything that has this thing on the side refers to something in the human realm. There's an animal radical. There is a plant radical. There's an herbaceous plant. We'll have the plant radical. There's also a religion radical, a piece that when you see it on characters, usually indicates that that character has something to do with religion or a ritual or spirituality or something like that. If I drew the radical fully, the religion radical fully, this is what it would look like. Apparently it's originally the picture of the night sky and stars sending rays of light down so that people would do astrological divination or signs from the heavens. Some people think. That's why it also means to indicate as well as having a general sense of spirituality. For example, the Chinese character for a spirit, shan, you can see it has the religion radical and this is the phonetic that gives you the pronunciation shan, which the Japanese pronounce shin, as in Shinto, the way of the gods. Can you see it from back there, Yanlu? Shanfu. Shanfu means literally God Father, but it's the Chinese word for a Roman Catholic priest. So there was a Chinese character that was pronounced chan and it actually referred to the ceremony whereby a king appoints his successor. What do we call that? The ceremony of succession to the throne. But it was pronounced chan. So they decided to use that character just for its sound value. I don't know if you can see it in the back, but for chan to stand for the Sanskrit word. But they were very clever, very clever because not only does it have the radical that tells you it has something to do with spirituality and this phonetic here that gives you the sound chan, but this phonetic has its own meaning. This phonetic means singleness. So looking at the character, not only does it have the sound chan, but it has a visual implication of show or indicate or manifest singleness. And so it has connotations that cannot be captured easily in English. So what does it mean to manifest singleness? Some Zen masters explain Zen by parsing the character in the way that I just described. They'll say, what is Zen? Zen is to manifest singleness. It's also true in the religion of the West, in Catholicism, in the Middle Ages. The entire spiritual endeavor was called simplificatio, simplification. Meditation, what we now call meditation, was referred to as simplificatio or simplification. In Greek haplosis. Sanctus simplicitus, have you ever heard that? Holy simplicity. It was held out as an ideal. Now if you take the Latin word simplex, what does it literally mean? Simplex. Well, it means single fold as opposed to multiplicity, which means a many foldedness. So how do we come to sanctus simplicitus, this holy simplicity? How do we manifest singleness as this character connotes? Well, the way I like to look at it is that the content of our experience is immensely, immensely complex. However, there is a unifying principle. However complex the content of an individual experience may be, all experience comes to us through six sense gates. I don't know of any experience that is not some combination or subset of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, body sensation, and thinking. So we can reduce the infinity of complexity to the relative simplicity of different combinations and subsets of sense experience by keeping track of the sense components. But of course, that gives us an experience that is six fold, not one fold. Once we can get down to experiencing the world in terms of the coming and going of our sense gates, then we can start to see that all of these sense gates have something in common. There is an underlying movement in nature that presents itself in the sense gates, in the changing intensities and shapes and rhythms of our sense gates. We come to experience the basic forces of expansion and contraction. You may have a sensation that seems very pressured, very solid, but as you inquire, does it want to push out, does it want to pull in, does it do both at the same time, you'll usually get an answer. And you'll be able to experience that sensation in terms of these fundamental forces. So that the six sense gates at some point start to present wave, vibration, undulation. And you're now aware of just two basic activities, although they are interwoven in various ways. You're aware of a force of increase and a force of decrease, a force of affirmation, a force of negation, a force that pushes out, a force that pulls in. So now the complexity of the six senses is reduced to the simplicity, relative simplicity of impermanence. But you're not yet into true simplification, one-foldness, because there's two-fold. There's expansion and contraction, there's spread and collapse. As you yield and give yourself to the flow of impermanence, a time comes when expansion and contraction, instead of being polarized, co-mingle and neutralize each other. And there is a cessation of everything, because the basic forces that churn things into existence have canceled themselves out. So there is a cessation of everything. But that cessation of everything is a very rich nothing, because all of the richness of the sense experience has been digested into the wave of expansion and contraction. And all the energy, the kinetic energy of that wave, is present potentially in the zero of that cessation. When we speak about emptiness or nothingness, most people it sounds very bleak, but when I hear the Buddhist word emptiness, what comes to my mind is incredible power. Power to what is zero. Zero contains all of the positives and all of the negatives, all of the yeses and all of the noes, needed to mold this or any conceivable universe. So when you follow this path of getting intangible contact with the senses, you simplify your experience at one level by that, then that becomes even more simplified, because it becomes energy and wave. And then when you get to the true simplification, that which is single fold, which is zero, the one that is this very special nothing, that contains within it all that energy. So that's why it's a special nothing, it's a rich nothing. The knee hill of the mystic is very different from the knee hill of the knee hillist. It's a completely different critter, because of the path that you've taken to that nothing. And because it's that very special nothing, when it repolarizes, as it inevitably will, you are able to experience how there is creatio ex nihilo, the arising, or in the Hebrew, the continuous creation of something from nothing. So you actually can experience and even participate in a continuous act of divine creation. To do this is to source. I think Werner Erhardt created this verb, to source. Any of you ever heard source used as a verb? I think it's a wonderful expression. So to manifest singleness, okay, comes about this way. That's what singleness is. From that singleness then, once again, multiplicity will arise. And we actually participate in it. But of course, in order to participate in the source, you have to start to be a little bit like the source. And the source is very bouncy and elastic and rubbery. So this process that we put ourselves through of infusing our ordinary experience with mindfulness and equanimity could be looked upon as a step-by-step procedure that leads us to this manifesting of singleness. And then allows us to also participate in how that singleness once again polarizes, starts to vibrate, and within, just like the ocean churns foam into existence. If you ever notice, it's fascinating to watch the waves come in on the shore. The wave comes in, it's expanding towards the shore, expanding towards the shore. The wave's coming in, expanding towards the shore. And at some point, an undertow develops. And there's two forces working. The top of the wave is expanding towards the shore, but the underside of the wave is contracting out at exactly the same time. And it's at that point that it starts to churn foam into existence. One part is expanding, the other part is simultaneously contracting. There's a polarization that has taken place, and foam arises. You know how what the most common adjective that astronomers and cosmologists use when they are asked to describe the largest level of structure of the universe? When they're asked to describe how are the galaxies distributed in the universe? You know how they usually describe it? Foam. The galaxies are like the molecules in a foam. It's that kind of distribution. So the biggest, most intense clumpings of matter that we know of in the universe are just like trillions and trillions and trillions of spongy bubbles. That's basically what the universe is, this big spongy bubble bath with lots of incredible voids. That foam is churned into existence by the forces of expansion and contraction, as is the foam of talk, image, and feel self. And when you contact directly the underlying forces that churn your ego into existence, you are also contacting the forces that create supernovas, quasars, that churn the foam of the galaxies into existence, or that churn the foam of an electron cloud effusively around the contractive core of the nucleus of the atom. Those forces are the same forces, the same, the two hands of God. Not that they're physical hands exactly, but if you want to think of God as molding, think of just the action of molding without the physical hands. What does a sculptor do? Expand a little bit here, contract a little bit there at various scales, and form appears. So as we are paying attention to just what is, with time a sensitivity to the essential spirit flux of our senses develops. And to the extent that we become that, to the extent that we're sensitive to that and yield to that and let it meditate us, to that extent we become that. We cease being a noun, we become a verb for a period of time. Inevitably we at some point return to being a thing, a particle. The issue however is freedom. If you talk to engineers, they'll say it's really cool that we can look at things both from the wave paradigm and the particle paradigm, because certain applications work better if you look upon light as a stream of particles, and other applications work better if you look upon it as being a wave. So you're free to take which application, which paradigm, you're free to choose the appropriate paradigm for the application. So certain things in this human life, it's appropriate to be a particle, to allow yourself to freeze into a separate entity. For other applications in this human life, it's appropriate to be a wave. The problem is most human beings can only be a particle, only be a rigid shard of ice, and so when stuff comes up where it's appropriate to understand yourself as a wave, they can't and then they have either a less than satisfactory experience or they have a horrible experience. A particle, if you hit it with a hammer, will shatter. If you scratch it with a nail, the scar remains. But you can bang all you want on a river, you can cut it all you want. You cannot shatter its structure. You cannot leave any lasting wound. So if you find yourself for three hours in the dentist's office being brutalized, let's hope that you have some concept of what it's like not to be a rigid shard of ice. But of course it's not only at those painful times, but at other times also that it's appropriate to have the wave paradigm. So when we cease being a noun for a short period of time and we become a verb, then we are sourcing. We are participating in the activity of the source. But of course it's an awesome thing to participate in the activity of the source because the source just happens, whereas human beings are creatures of will and desire and need and fear. The process of creation in Buddhism is technically called pratityasamutpada. Have you ever heard this term? Some of you may have encountered it if you've read scholarly books. What it means is some, S-A-M means together. Ut is actually ultimately cognate to the English word out and it means up. And pada means to fall. So it means things fall into existence. Very interesting way of describing. There's a certain effortless quality, just like a leaf falls down. Well, the universe falls up. It just happens. So to source means to participate in that effortless falling up. So it means a temporary suspension of the human perspective of will, desire, need and fear. That's why one shouldn't use the word sourcing lightly. I think in the new age people may use that word lightly, not realizing quite the implications. Speaking of Chinese culture, Confucianism, putidama. There's a Chinese expression. Let's see if I get it right. Wanli changxing shiyi zuxia. Is it right? Did I get it right? Something like that. A journey of 10,000 miles starts with one step. I've talked about this awesome experience of becoming the activity that is reflected in the life of the stars and atoms. I've talked about how to the extent that a person participates in that activity for even a few minutes. To that extent you become that activity and to that extent you're quite immortal to that extent, to the extent that you have become familiar with that activity. But it all starts with small tangible steps. One aspect, one tangible step is to be very clear about exactly what one is experiencing in the moment. So apropos of that, I'd like to just take a couple minutes to clarify a little bit more about the way that I'm going to have you be working in your meditation, at least in the guided meditations and in the online. In traditional Buddhism, as I mentioned yesterday, they talk about six sense gates. You know what they are. I like to break two of those sense gates into finer categories. I like to break the thinking into visual mental processing, which I call image, and verbal mental processing, which I call talk. And I like to break the body sensation into a sort of subjective pole and an objective pole, which I call respectively feel and touch. I'm not happy with those words, but if you can come up with something better, let me know. The basic discovery of the Buddha is that when there is this illusory sense of limited existence that arises when we lose track of the components of our experience, which is most of the time for most people. Broadly, in the broadest formulation, our sense of personal self arises from an interplay of the internal conversation, the mental image, and anything that happens in the body. In many languages of the world, body is also the word for self. So even the physical touches on the body are sort of meat. But in a somewhat more narrow formulation, the sense of self arises from the interaction of internal conversation, mental image, and the subjective side of the body, the feelings. They're a little bit closer to the core, to our sense of personal identity. In other words, the clothes touch you, that's one thing. When your heart is touched, that's a little bit closer to the sense of I am. When I have people work clarifying this what am I koan, this gnothi se aton, as the ancient Greek said, know thyself, or atma vichara, the investigation of who am I, as some of the Hindus say. Sometimes I will have you work broadly, talk, image, body. Sometimes I'll have you work more narrowly, talk, image, and just the feeling aspect of the body. And you can decide for yourself if you want to even use these categories. Like I say, you may find that all of that is just far more complex and efforting than you want to do, so you just stay with the breath and that's fine, or mantra, whatever you use. But if you want to explore this clarification of the arising of self, you can do it either way. Bit, B-I-T, body, image, talk, or fit, which is a subset of that, feel, image, talk. That makes sense, doesn't it? Anybody have any questions about that? Just to clarify terminology. I find that if I'm going through a lot of emotion, it's easier for me to narrow the focus to fit, feel, image, talk. But if I'm not, I'll tend to just work with anything that comes up in the body, because a lot of times you don't have feel. One of the problems in giving people categories, I've noticed, people seem to think that because I say that you might experience this, you might experience this, or this, there's an implication that you should have all those experiences. So I'll tell people, now it might be this, it might be this, it might be this, and then I'll say, how's that going? And they'll say, well, I got number one and number two, but I didn't get number three. As if I had said, try to get all this stuff, which I really didn't. I just said, you might experience this, you might experience that. What I'm calling feel is not always present. Sometimes we're emotionally resting. There's almost always physical touch on the body of some sort. But sometimes we completely emotionally rest, there's no internal reactions at all, and that's fine. So you have, as I say, you can work at the bit scope or the fit scope, depending on what seems to work best for you at a given time. There is within feel, image, and talk, a certain subset of feel, a certain subset of image, and a certain subset of talk, which is particularly instructive. All of it, of course, is instructive. But there's talk, some of your self-talk is about what am I going to have for lunch, or I wonder who's going to win the football pool. But you also have other kind of self-talk that says, this is what's wrong with me, this is the way I've always been, I'll never be able to change this, come on, who am I fooling? Or self-talk about, I really am pretty cool. Gee, I look good today. Yeah, they're praising me. Some of our self-talk, or some of our talk, is about ourself. It's not just talking to ourself, it's talking about ourselves, positively or negatively. Some of our image is what we look like, our perception of this is what I look like. So some of the talk and some of the image is quote self-referential. It's about ourself. Right? Anybody had any self-referential talk or image arising? When we compare ourself to another person, any comparison, whether it's to compare and say I'm cooler or I'll never be as cool, any comparison is called mana in the Buddhist tradition, which is from the root ma, meaning to measure. It is a habit that we have to measure ourselves against others. So some of the talk and some of the image relates to our sense of self, and so does some of the feel. Somebody praises us, we have one kind of sensation, the flavor of approbation. It's a pleasant one, isn't it? Somebody condemns us, or we condemn ourselves, we're embarrassed, we feel guilty about something, we have sensations also. Or we feel very self-conscious, we walk into a room full of strangers and they're all looking at us, we have body sensations, right? Those are self-referential body sensations. They are very related to our sense of I am-ness. Of course, any body sensation, any feel is related. So of particular interest is the talk, image, and feel that is directly referring to our sense of self. If you can have the experience of self-referential talk, image, and feel with mindfulness and equanimity, you're doing awful good. So there's sort of like concentric spheres in general body image talk, more specifically feel image talk, most specifically self-referential feel, self-referential tapes, self-referential images, are what's behind our sense of self. And to learn how not to suppress it, but also to learn how not to fixate it, is to learn how to experience body image talk, feel image talk, or our sense of self-consciousness or self-evaluation. To learn how to experience that as part of the effortless flux of nature and spirit. Did I ever tell you about the nerd calendar? Once you understand the Dharma, you can see it everywhere. You literally can see it everywhere. I was in a bookstore a number of years ago, and they had calendars for sale. Girly calendars, poetry calendars, all different sorts of calendars, the this of the month or the that of the month kind of thing. But one of the calendars they had for sale is unlike anything I'd ever seen. And it really grabbed my attention. Basically what it was, was a nerd of the month calendar. It was photographs, very nicely done, of 12 exceedingly nerdy guys. Not joking, this actually was for sale. And what was interesting about it, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to look at every month, each nerd. Take in a second. What is a nerd? You don't have this word in Canada? Okay, folks, we need to educate the Canuck lady about Yankee idioms. What is a nerd? A geek. What's a geek? Gawky, awkward, homely. Yeah. Schnooky. Nebbish. Yeah, nebbish. That would be the Sanskrit. Yeah, it's sort of like, uh, huh? Dilbert. Yeah. Well, why was I drawn to look at each one of the nerds? Was that there was something different about these nerds? No, but not unrelated. Each one 100% gloried in his nerdiness. Okay? They were just like totally just manifesting themselves as the avatar of nerd without any this or that. So it's what my teacher calls a full manifestation of that self. And it was beautiful. It was attractive. So the lesson there is that they didn't fixate or resist their self-consciousness. And it turned into something beautiful. And it's quite true. It's quite true. So when these aspects of experience come up, you now have the categories and you know that you can work with them. Allow the self to arise, churned into existence moment by moment. And then in a sense, everything you do will be beautiful. So when self-consciousness comes up, when self-judgment comes up, this is premier opportunity. It's the core of the core. Okay? If talk, image and feel is the core of the self, then those talk, image and feel are the core of the core. I said I wanted to be crystal clear about the categories. Talk includes, in my formulation, tunes, internal tunes. If you find you're doing lyrics or whatever. But it excludes something like ringing in your ear or tinnitus. Sometimes people ask is that part of talk. And of course it certainly excludes external sound. So if you're attending to internal talk, you would ignore external sounds and you would also ignore things like ringing in your ears. But you would include things like tunes that you can't stop humming. Anybody ever get that phenomenon? My favorite is Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts program. The original. That to me is part of the internal dialog. Basically, if you're not filling it with dialog, you just fill it with music. Okay? Because we're in the habit of filling it with something. By the way, one thing that you might find productive if you get internal tunes that you just can't stop and it's annoying to you, is if it's annoying, it's annoying. That means that there is a body sensation associated with your reaction to the presence of that tune. And you may not be able to do much with the tune, but you can observe the sense of annoyance or imposition as a tangible body sensation, which is quite interesting. But one thing that you may discover is, you may discover that you have another flavor of sensation associated with those internal tunes. And you know what that flavor of sensation is? The pleasure of being amused by it. My internal tunes didn't go away until I was able to simultaneously be aware, at exactly the same moment, of both the sensation of being annoyed that I couldn't get rid of the tune, and the subtle sensation of being entertained by the tune. When I was able to simultaneously detect and have equanimity with those two sensations is when the tunes went away. Just share that with you for what it's worth. With respect to image, image for me means visual mental processing. That means that splashes of color or geometric patterns that you may see, or the light that comes in through your eyelids, is not part of mental image. Mental image means a mental image. It doesn't mean that it's clear like a photograph, but it is a form that you're using to think. By that I mean to remember something, to plan something, to fantasize something, to know what just produced the sound when your eyes are closed, to remember where you are and what you look like. This is what I mean by mental image. When you talk about geometric mental image, are you talking about visual geometric or image geometric? Am I being clear? Yes, that would not be part of mental image. Sort of kaleidoscopic type, that I would also not include as mental image. No. Basically you're not thinking with that, even though it's internally generated. Those splashes of color and kaleidoscopes and geometric forms are to the image process what the ringing in your ears is to the internal conversation. You're not really using it as a medium to think in. So ringing in your ears is not a sound that comes from the outside, but it's not something you think with. And splashes of colors, the proverbial purple clouds, kaleidoscopic type things, they're internally generated. They're not coming from the outside, but you're not really thinking in those images. So I don't count those as image. If you're entertaining yourself with kaleidoscopic, I suggest you focus on the flavor of the image. Being entertained. But by and large, what I'm trying to get you to do is penetrate the thinking process. So in my own vocabulary, I call the sounds that you hear that are sort of like tinnitus or ringing in your ear, that, whatever, I call it pseudo sound, because it's not really from the outside, but it's not really internal talk or tune. And forms that you may see that are like splashes of color or kaleidoscopic, I call that pseudo light, because it's more like light than it is like a mental image. Now if you see a Buddha and it's sort of radiating light and whatever, that would be a mental image, of course. Basically, subtle as I use it, is a default category. By that I mean, anything that's not, if you don't have any image at all, that's one extreme. If you have a clear image that you can say it's this or that, that's another extreme. And then we need to have a term for the whole range of stuff that's in between. It's not an absence, but it's not a clear presence, so I call that subtle. Analogously with the internal conversation. Okay, good. Are there any other questions about that? I know this is sort of picky, but the devil is in the details. I once heard Upendita say that even the batting of your eyelash completely changes consciousness. Okay, so to really know exactly what we're focusing on and what we're not focusing on at any given moment is very important. The name of the game in this practice is selective attention. Attention can be broad or attention can be narrow. That's not the issue. The issue is when you've defined what you are selectively attending to, you have partitioned the realm of experience into two mutually exclusive subsets. That which you are focusing on, which may be broad or narrow, and everything else. And until you intentionally change your defined object of meditation, you mercilessly ignore, to the best of your ability, anything that is not in your defined object of meditation. Because what you are attempting to do is develop a momentum, a critical mass of unbroken attentiveness with regard to the object of focus. Because it's only when you get unbroken attentiveness that the essential waveform can present itself. So if your object of meditation is mental image, as soon as you define your object of meditation as mental image, you may discover that your body just explodes. And as soon as you define your object of meditation to be internal conversation, you may discover that the images just explode. And then people say, what should I do? Until you have intentionally changed your object of focus, even though the competing thing may explode a thousand times more intensely than your defined object of focus, you stay with your defined object of focus. And do what? Monitor the impact of the competing phenomenon on your object of focus. There are only the following possibilities. A competing phenomenon will either stimulate the object of focus, or it will cause the object of focus to become quiescent, or it will have no effect at all. But your job is to know that and not let yourself get pulled as much as possible into the competing thing. Until you've changed, and you can change frequently, but you intentionally change. So that you get that sense of developing this momentum of continuity of contact until the thing starts to soften and show you its essential spirit form. So I think that's what I want to say about that. Yes, was there a question in the back? I was thinking about, there's something called the nada sound? Nada, N-A-D-A. Of course in Spanish it's something else, but nada in Sanskrit means a sound. But specifically, it often refers to what's called nada yoga, which is meditation on subtle sounds that you hear inside your ear. Like ringing in the ear or tinnitus type sounds. Except if you focus on those sounds, the more you focus on them, the more interesting they become and then you start to notice harmonics. And basically what you attempt to do is detect the subtle overtones. And of course that makes you, you have to get very concentrated. When you listen to a whisper, you get very concentrated. And then behind those subtler ones, you detect subtler ones and subtler ones. And it's basically a way of developing, sort of taking you deep in consciousness and developing a lot of concentration power. It's basically a shamatha exercise from my perspective, not an insight practice. But it's used in Tibetan Buddhism also. It's called sound yoga. Q. It's a certain feeling? A. Well it's sounds that we hear on the inside. No one quite knows what causes tinnitus or ringing in the ears medically. But the organ of corti is extremely sensitive and apparently very small physical fluctuations there or perhaps in the vestibulo acoustic nerve will cause the perception of internally generated sounds. And there are whole paths for working just with that phenomenon. Q. You were speaking about a lot of attentiveness. Could you talk about that with regards to using a very wide focus? A. What becomes of the meaning of selective attention if your object of meditation is everything? In essence is what you're asking. In that case, this is something some of you have heard me talk about but I'll just briefly repeat it. There is a technical term in Pali, karnika samadhi. Samadhi has many meanings. It can mean concentration in general but it can also mean a concentration that is so great that you merge with the thing you concentrate on. A sense of penetrating or becoming. Karna means a short period of time, an instant. So karnika means for an instant. The idea being that if you have a broad focus, in fact even if you have a narrow focus, it makes no difference. Each phenomenon as it comes up is experienced with a kind of penetrating awareness. Your awareness sort of soaks into it and there's a sense of merging. Now if you're focusing at the tip of your nose, those mergings are with each teeny little impact as it arises. If you're focusing on all phenomena, those mergings are with each sense experience as it arises. So you may know the expression to make and break that's used in electronics. There's a make and a break. A connection is made and then a connection is broken, like on a keyboard. Well you sort of have this make break, make break, make break, where you merge with the object and then you break that merging and then there's a merging with another object that may be something vastly different. So if it's at the tip of your nose, it's the same thing over and over again. But there is with each little impact a sort of make break, make break, make break of a merging. All that happens when you do it large is that it's large. You hear a sound and for that moment there's nothing but that sound and there is a clear sense of samadhi with that, for just a second, with that sound. And then that samadhi is broken and there's a body sensation and there's this clear sense of samadhi with this body sensation. It's made and then it's broken and then there's the next thing that comes up and there's a merging with it. So that even though the objects are distributed through space and are very different in terms of their character, each one has a momentary, tangible sense of having been experienced with high concentration. Therefore, the sense of focus that you would get if you were able to hold your concentration at the tip of your nose for two hours and the sense of focus that you would get if your awareness were going all over the universe, but palpably merging with each sense experience as it comes up, those two experiences would be indistinguishable. Because the second one is an unbroken sequence of samadhi. So it adds up to the same thing as a very narrow focus. I don't know if that makes any sense, but that's how it's described. You just have to sort of get a feel for this one. The Mahasi tradition, the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition, which is sort of the mainstream vipassana from Burma, considers this, what I've just said, to be of the utmost importance. And their acharyas, their sayadas, are always trying to sort of describe what I'm now describing. As your mindfulness develops at that moment of merging, the whole thing is just a waveform. You actually experience the impermanence of it right then and there, even though it's only for a short period of time. That's one of the reasons that we do these retreats, because it takes day after day after day after day after day after day to finally build up the ability to do that. I remember by the end of a two-month retreat with the Burmese master Upandita, they had, and it was a real source of aversion, they had a grandfather clock or some sort of very noisy clock in the meditation hall, that was constantly going tick tick tick tick. You could constantly hear it. And of course, you're supposed to work with whatever comes up. By the end of that two months, I could detect the beginning, middle and end of the tick, and the beginning, middle and end of the tock, each time. It was like it just bubbled up from the universe and returned. But of course, it took a long, long time to develop that. So when you get that khanika samadhi, it's an insight samadhi. It's not only that palpable sense of penetrating, but it's sort of like you penetrate it with awareness and it melts. And then you go to the next thing and you penetrate it with awareness and it melts. You've got to get a feel for it. I think I'm way beyond my time here. And I had intended to talk less because my mouth ain't in good shape. But you see what happened. So I thank you for your patience. And I congratulate you for sitting in the same room with Bodhidharma, because the vibe I get is that you guys are sitting like this guy.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.4, "text": " Yen Lu, did you bring this?
