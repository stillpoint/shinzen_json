{"text": " The topic for today's talk is sexuality and the spiritual path. And as I look out into the audience here, I see a lot of familiar faces. So probably most of you already know what I'm going to say, right? Don't you? More or less. That's one of the interesting things about the meditative path, especially the path of vipassana. It's pretty generic. In other words, you take any specific topic and the same basic principles will be applicable there. So what you already know from having heard many, many times talks on different topics, just imagine applying that to the experience of sexuality and you already pretty much know what I'm going to say. And yet, you did come to hear a lecture, so I will have to fulfill my function, otherwise the center will collapse and I'll have different types of difficulties. And also, it really is an important function that I do, which is to say that I repeat the same things over and over and over again. That's an important and legitimate function, because we find ourselves forgetting, don't we? Constantly. Constantly finding myself forgetting. It's one of the reasons I set up this center, to make sure that at least I'd be reminding myself every Sunday, because I would have to be speaking about it. Because this spiritual knowledge is not like factual information, that you just get more and more and more factual information and spread out horizontally like that. Really the pieces of information are very few, but one's appreciation or understanding of it deepens, deepens, deepens, deepens. So it's a sort of vertical learning. Everything that I have to say about the topic could be counted on the fingers of both hands. And yet, one hears it year after year and understands it at deeper and deeper levels. Ultimately, what we're trying to do is, in point of fact, communicate with that part of our being which is pre-verbal. We're trying to train what we might call the animal levels within ourselves. Now when I say animal levels, that doesn't imply a prejudice that, oh, there's some sort of bad or evil in that sense of animal, but simply in the sense of primitive. Right now as you're listening to my talk, you're listening with the surface of consciousness, but instant by instant, instant by instant, preceding the arising of your awareness and my awareness on the surface of consciousness, there are unconscious, deep, primitive processing routines that are going on. Now they happen very, very rapidly, but they're at the level of the mouse or the level of the lizard. And ultimately, to become a liberated person means that the spiritual understanding has seeped down to those levels. But how do you give a sermon to a mouse or a lizard? Doesn't understand words, right? You could talk forever, right? In fact, they even have this phrase in Japanese, giving a sermon to a horse. It's like our expression to, what do they say, before swine, what is it? Cast pearls before swine. How do you give a sermon to a horse? So the way that ultimately the understanding percolates down into those levels of our being is through direct experience, especially at the level of sensation. You train a mouse by, if it does the wrong response, it gets a little painful sensation, like a shock. If it does the right response, it gets a pleasant sensation, like some food. And that way you can train a mouse. Now underneath the human within each one of us is a colony of thousands and thousands of little mice-like subroutines that do our processing unconsciously. How do we train all those little mice down there? Well, actually nature has provided us with a built-in mechanism to do that. When we pay attention to our own process, especially when we pay attention to our own process at the level of pure sensation, that is to say at the level of pure pleasure and pain, whenever we're doing that, we are feeding clarity or awareness down into the deeper levels of consciousness, so that when those blind subroutines are activated, if they activate in a negative way, negativities, impurities of consciousness, always enhance our suffering. But those negativities don't know what they're doing. They're just blind subroutines. As we're paying attention to the pleasure and pain within us, when a negativity in the deep mind arises, there's an enhanced suffering, an aversion negativity, and there's a diminished fulfillment if it's a craving negativity. And we become increasingly aware of the ebb and flow of our sense of exaggerated suffering and our sense of diminished fulfillment. And that awareness starts to filter down into those impurities themselves. And they start to feel, they start to know, oh, when I grab like this, there is less fulfillment. When I push away like that, there is enhanced, it hurts a little bit more. They start to actually feel the effect of what they're doing. And just like the classical, literally the classical Pavlovian conditioning, those primitive parts of our being are conditioned out of their negativity. But this is a Pavlovian conditioning that we generate ourselves. We create a channel between surface consciousness and deep consciousness by the act of focusing awareness. And in that way, we condition deep or primitive consciousness out of its negative habits. So as you're listening to my talk now, this will seep down as far as it can seep down. And for that, to get to those more primitive levels, one would have to take on an actual formal practice. So they say that there are three levels of understanding. The first is when you hear it and it sort of makes sense to you. Even that may take quite a while. The words that I say today, most of you will understand them quite clearly. But those very same words said to many, many other individuals on this planet would just go right through. They wouldn't register at all. So that's called the first level of understanding is where you hear and it makes sense. Second level of understanding is when you can remember it and think about it to yourself and explain it to others and have a sort of mental recall where you can investigate it yourself. So it's not just passively hearing. And then the third level of understanding is when it starts to seep down into the body, you might say. Really even for the first level of understanding, one has to hear over and over and over again. So I will now repeat what I always say. But I will repeat it with respect to sexual experience. It's very interesting that in many people's minds and in many spiritual traditions, sacred is over here and sex is over here. And they're like, there's a whole taboo or an uptightness or a guilt or what have you. And one may sort of consider why that situation is, how that comes about. It seems to me that, and this is just my own opinion of course, that the reason so many cultures, and it certainly is not just Western culture, the reason that so many cultures have a sort of uptightness about sexuality is that we're not really experiencing it quite the way nature intended us to. So because of that, afterwards we feel that something wasn't quite right. And that sense of something not being quite right may manifest in different ways, like depression, or like feelings of guilt, or like feelings of embarrassment, or like feelings of God's mad at you, or like feelings that you want to go unconscious right away, the proverbial smoking a cigarette, or watching TV, or going to sleep right away, something to sort of avoid the way you feel afterwards, takes many, many forms. So what constitutes the right way, or to put it in a somewhat more colloquial phrase, what constitutes quote good sex? What is good sex? I like that phrase. That may be an offensive phrase to people, but I think that's a good phrase. What is good sex? Good sex for me, again it's my own personal definition, would be a sexual experience, could be many, many types of sexual experiences we have, right? A sexual experience after which you have permanently changed in a positive direction. That would be good sex. In other words, there is an evolutionary quality to it. Something after each sexual experience, whatever your sexual orientation or object may be, whatever your sexual practice may be, I'm not going to comment on that, whatever the sexual experience is, if afterwards there was a permanent change in the way that you are, and it was a positive change, what do I mean by positive change? Positive change is that your sense of the oneness of things was enhanced from that time on. Or that the impurities, some impurities worked their way out. Something like that. But permanently. Because when we talk about the, we use these phrases, sexual release, that is usually quite temporary and in fact inconsequential. If there is, however, a permanent release, then this is the quote, good sex. So how would one go about having each sexual experience, small or big, result in a permanent transformation? In other words, result in taking another step in one's spiritual path? Suppose there are various ways to go about this. I'll just describe to you one, which I am familiar with. Sexual experience is pleasant. Pleasant sensations arise within the body. On the meditative path, a lot of times, especially in Buddhism, we have a certain problem in that we are often talking about all the unpleasant experiences that you are going to have in meditation, right? And we tell you how to make use of unpleasant experiences. And what do we say? What do we say? How do you make use if you are sitting and your leg starts to hurt? Watch it. And how do you watch it? Right. With equanimity, right? And when we say the word watch, of course, we don't mean watch with the eye, we mean enhanced awareness poured into whatever that sense gate may be. In this case, it's the body sense. So you sort of have a greater precision, a relatively greater sense of equanimity, matter of factness, and also we ask you to see anicca. What does anicca mean? Impermanence. All sensation is changing. Now sometimes you can have a sensation that seems very solid. That just means you have to watch more patiently to see the impermanence. The impermanence is subtle there. Sometimes you have sensations that are very sort of jagged and stabbing and gripping and spasming. That just means that the impermanence is taking on a non-smooth form, a rough form, but it's still impermanence. It's a certain perspective on sensation. Now the reason we bring this perspective up often with respect to unpleasant sensation is that, well, it's actually twofold. One is practical. When you're sitting there, you're not used to the posture yet, you're sitting for long periods of time, and things will tend to percolate up, emotions percolate up. So to give people a strategy of what to do to see that it's not bad to have those unpleasant sensations. The second reason we talk about unpleasant sensations a lot is that it is easier to get insight by and large with the unpleasant sensations than it is to get insight with the pleasant ones. Now this is not 100% true all the time for everybody, but by and large it is easier to get insights, or that is to say permanent transformations, with unpleasant sensations than with pleasant ones. Do you agree or disagree? How about your own experience? There was a great vipassana master in Burma named Sun Lun Sayadaw, and he had a very distinctive method of meditating. Now there's been a number of famous teachers, each one was very distinct. There's the Mahasi method, the U Ba Khin method, Thang Phulu had his method. Well Sun Lun is another famous teacher. Whenever I tell about his method though, I have a little bit of trepidation because it is, shall we say, the ultimate taking the bull by the horns. You don't have to practice this method, but he felt that all people in this age, their concentration wasn't good and their minds were weak and whatever. So he had this method where you would sit and for an hour do breath meditation, but the breath meditation was not just watching the breath, it was hyperventilating for one hour and watching the sensations in the body. This is sort of like exponential rebirthing, right? This is like, you know what rebirthing or process like that is. Sit in a group as hard as you can for one hour watching every sensation in the body and you take a strong determination vow for an hour, two hours, three hours, I won't move any part of my body and just continue to watch the aftermath of that. And just of course at that point, nothing but unpleasant sensation, too much unpleasant sensation to even think or anything. You take the most prominent unpleasant sensation and you just grit your teeth, you clench your fist, you white knuckle and you watch that sensation for however many hours you can sit there. That's like only dealing with unpleasant sensation. Now don't get scared, you don't have to do that to get enlightenment, okay? But that's sort of one kind of practice. And anyway, he said, you can take two paths, there is the sukha patipada and there is dukkha patipada. You can take the path of bliss or you can take the path of pain, or both. There's two ways to nirvana, okay? The only reason that he taught this dukkha patipada, or the path of making use of pain, was that it was a little bit more practical in terms of the goal. But if you could take the path of bliss, fine, take the path of bliss. His metaphor was that your goal is to have this equanimous mindful awareness. Now he said, imagine that you're a swimmer and you're swimming in a river. And as you're swimming, somebody is on the shore and they're holding out some flowers for you, okay? And you want to get those flowers. That's what you're swimming for, you're swimming for the flowers. Now you could swim, the flower in this case is the mindful awareness, or the witness consciousness, that is to say, vipassana, on your own process. That moment of awareness, of full awareness, is the flower. Now you could swim either with the stream or against it, okay? You could swim with the current and reach out and grab the flowers. Or you could swim against the current, reach out and grab the flower of awareness. The only thing is, if you swim with the current, okay, it's going to move very fast and if you miss it, that's it, okay? You don't get another chance. You're just going to be swept away. If you swim against the current, though, even if while you're going by you miss it, you might say the current will pull you back and give you another chance. If you're meditating on pleasure, the danger is you can so easily miss it, miss your moment of mindfulness and just go into a sort of being seduced into the pleasure. Because pleasure has a certain unconscious sort of seductive quality to it that makes it difficult to have that intense clarity or that moment of insight. And once you've missed it, you're just gone, you're just swept out. Mindfulness is gone, specificity is gone. On the other hand, let's say you're going against the stream, right? In other words, you're meditating with discomfort. Even if you can't concentrate, you'll have to concentrate because the discomfort will pull your attention to it. It will rivet your attention eventually and you will have mindfulness whether you like it or not. Nature will force it on you because you won't be able to attend to anything else. So he said for that reason, it's easier to have the moment of awareness when you're dealing with discomfort. That was his metaphor. I would say from my own experience, another aspect is that you quickly begin to see as you're sitting there that if you open up and don't fight with the discomfort, that your sense of suffering goes down a bit, right? Maybe just a little bit, but there's some diminishing of the sense of this is a problem. As soon as there's a sort of relaxing and opening up to the discomfort. That happens fairly quickly. And then you start to think, oh, if some opening, if some letting go of my aversion or fighting brings some relief, then more opening will bring more relief. And you extrapolate upon that and you say, well, let's get permanent relief. Let's break up the phenomenon of resistance within me for good. Okay, that's relatively, that, as hard as it is, is still relatively easy to see. For most people, it's quite a bit later that you start to realize the converse of that. That is to say, the first statement was when you greet uncomfortable sensations with less resistance or tightening, that they seem to cause less of a problem. The converse is when you greet pleasant sensations without holding and tightening, they provide a sense of deeper fulfillment or satisfaction. That is a bit subtler to see. So the motivation to have a letting go attitude with respect to the spread of pleasure, that motivation usually comes later in people's practice. The motivation to have an attitude of openness and non-tightening with respect to pain usually comes a little earlier in people's practice. So whether you want to use Sun Lung's metaphor or whether you want to think of it in terms of what I just said, the fact is, often Buddhist teachers will talk about the dukkha patipada, how to use the uncomfortable things. But let's talk today about how to use the pleasant things. In fact, it's the same talk, right? It's the same kind of awareness exactly, enhanced precision, enhanced matter of factness, and a knowledge that those pleasant sensations are moving. That when applied to pleasant sensation makes a pleasant sensation a source of purification. That is to say, it breaks up knots. It leads to a fluidification of one's being. So what we're trying to do is become fluid beings. And the original crystallization of ourselves took place around pleasure and pain. And the breaking up of the crystalline nature and the return of fluidity to our world can also come about through using the energy in pleasure and pain. And one uses it in the same way. So two things solidify our world. One is the tightening around pleasure. The other is the tightening around pain. So a person can merely explore pleasure. The most intense pleasure for most of us is sexual experiences, although any sort of pleasant experience, even a very subtle pleasant experience. Maybe someday you'll go to a really good talk. Maybe this talk is very meaningful for you or entertaining. When you're entertained, when you get it, when there is pleasant sensation at that time, a subtle pleasant sensation, watch that. You can use that. I find that when I hear a good talk or watch TV or something, I get waves of subtle bliss all over my body. They never stop, but they're very, very subtle. Okay, the sensations that come up in sexual activity involve subtle ones like that, but also some very strong, intensified, coarser, obvious sensations. The trick is, from time to time, when a person, when you so desire, you can make a decision. I'm going to use this sexual experience as a vehicle for the purification of consciousness. One makes that decision, and then it doesn't have to be every time, okay? Not every sexual encounter or interaction is necessarily appropriate to do this, but from time to time, one can make that decision. Yes, this is something I'm doing for my own personal growth. And you focus on the sensations, on the patterns of sensation, and try to maintain an attitude of relative equanimity. It won't be possible to have an attitude of perfect equanimity without a lot of practice. And what will happen? Wave after wave of pleasant sensations, erotic sensations, pleasant sensations, will arise. The trick is to be there at the beginning, middle, and end of each one of those individual waves of sexual feeling. If you can be there at the beginning, middle, and end of each one, watch the individual rising and passing away. In other words, watch the wave nature of it. Each wavelet of sexual feeling that you can do that with will break up a little pattern of craving in your life. The great thing about the sexual experience from the spiritual perspective is also the great problem with the sexual experience. It brings up the totality of the cravings. Remember the basic philosophy that I presented to you many, many times was that sensations are linked to mental impurities. There's nothing wrong with the sensations. In fact, we want to have the sensations. At the same time, we want to break up the impurities. The sexual pleasure is so great that when it is coming up, the sum total of one's cravings are also coming up. And that's why I suppose people, basically cultures, have this uptightness about sexuality. And then they get a huge confusion. There's something wrong with pleasure. Somewhere deep down, people think there's something wrong with pleasure. Because when the pleasure comes up, the cravings come up, and the cravings are impurities. There's something wrong with that. But there's nothing wrong with the pleasure. But then there's this confusion that takes place. The trick is to use the pleasure to undo the cravings. And the way to do that is be mindful. And each wavelet, it comes in hundreds and hundreds of individual little quantum packages of waves. How physicists speak of what a quantum package is, that's sort of like a little bundle. So what is sexual experience? It is a sequence of many, many little wavelets arising and spreading through the body, many of them simultaneously, five, six individual wavelets happening at once, each one pleasant, some large, some small, just a sequence of that. So there's hundreds and hundreds of individual arisings of pleasure. Some just teeny little trickles that go away. Others just like immense waves that may last for 30 seconds, a minute, two, three minutes even, a single wave, some of the very slow frequency ones that move through. Be they teeny little piccolos or deep tubas, whatever the frequency may be, what you've got is in essence a symphony of individual sensations arising. And the trick is to be mindful enough to be there with each one. And if you can't do that, to be mindful enough to be there with one or two. If you can just do it with one or two, that's pretty good. I personally find that the cliches of human language are very revealing. People tend to put down cliches, but I find deep wisdom often in these cliches. Maybe that's why you hear me use them from time to time also. One of the great cliches about sexuality is afterwards it's like, did the earth shake? Right? Did the earth shake for you? Right? Have you ever heard that expression? It wasn't really good sex unless the earth shaked. Now is that a poetic metaphor or is that a description of something actual? I'm not going to take a poll, but I wonder if I did. How many people would say it's a poetic metaphor and how many people would say, no, it's an actual experience, that is to say, it feels as though you were in an earthquake? It is not a poetic metaphor. It feels as though the room is moving, shifting, as though you're moving and shifting, as though the whole fixatedness of everything for a moment has gone away. That's the earthquake. In the story of Buddhism of the Buddha, it is said that the earth shook at the moment of his enlightenment. When you are having a sexual experience and the earth shakes for you, that means that one wavelet out of all of those hundreds or thousands was experienced fully. As simple as that. That was one complete total experience of pleasure. Where are you when the earth shakes in a sexual experience? Where are you? And where is the pleasure when the earth shakes in a sexual experience? The pleasure, are you over here and the pleasure over there at the time the earth shakes? Or is in fact the shaking the total dance of the oneness of you and the pleasure, to where there's no subject and object anymore? That is a mini, mini, mini, mini, mini enlightenment experience. That's the earth shaking for you. That is what we mean, or that is an aspect rather of what is meant by impermanence. Full experience, total experience of impermanence. If you can do that with one or two wavelets out of the totality of that whole sequence of sexual arising, if you can do it with one or two, that's pretty good. Pretty good. If you can do it with three or four, that's a lot better. If you can do it with all of them, then you're pretty, pretty far along. And at that time, in other words, where there's nothing but a sequence of the earth shaking, at that time you begin to experience what I was referring to at the beginning of this talk, which is to say a sexual experience that permanently, permanently changes the way you are from that time on. In order to experience that kind of depth of fulfillment, one has to understand the difference between pleasure and fulfillment. They are related, but not identical. Fulfillment is pleasure experienced with complete awareness and with no interference. So fulfillment is a function of the amount of pleasure, but also the amount of awareness and non-grasping. So you might say that in the experience of complete fulfillment, there's no pleasure as an object anymore. There's just fulfillment. And one begins to make an effort to apply meditative awareness within the sexual experience. And at first it's awful hard, awful hard. But you start to get a little taste of it, a little sense of it, and you get that sense of, gee, when I can experience the one wavelet from beginning to end, spread and pass away with no involvement, this is as though I was watching a wave on the shore. Amazingly enough, I feel this deep sense of satisfaction with that wavelet. Then the thought arises, oh, okay, so then this is what I really want. Before I thought I wanted pleasure as an object, but now I see that's not what I really want. What I want is fulfillment. What I want is purification. What I want is to break up, to have this experience be something that breaks up the limiting forces within me. And that thought grows and grows and grows as the years go on. And then the sexual experience deepens and deepens and deepens in its spiritual dimension. Until you start to have, quote, good sex, in the sense of the word that I just used the word a little while ago. That is to say, it does represent a mini enlightenment each time. What does it take to do this? It takes a lot of patience. It takes a lot of patience. Because you have to sort of wait for, well, how can I put it? Okay. It's difficult for me to verbalize this. Let us say that a wave of pleasure is about to arise. A wave of pleasure is about to arise. It is incipient. As soon as that wave of pleasure presents itself to the unconscious mind, there will be a tendency to grab. And that grabbing will sort of put pressure on that wave of pleasure. It will intensify it as an object, but it will diminish it as a fulfillment. So what you have to do is be very, very, very patient. And you sort of see a wave of pleasure is about to come, and you just sort of have to give up that tendency to grab and just sort of wait for it slowly to come. And in fact, even this aspect, this is when you're going into witness consciousness with the pleasure. Okay? And that's what the real deep sexual fulfillment comes when you're in the witness consciousness. Now, what is witness consciousness like? Some of you may have experienced it in very threatening situations. It's where all of a sudden everything gets very, very peaceful. Time seems to be going in slow motion, and you're just watching. Okay? You're not involved, and you're just watching. Some of you may have been in car accidents or had you been threatened, accosted in different ways and gone into this kind of state. Right? I'm sure, right? Already, quite a few people. Okay. This is witness consciousness. This is the state which we are trying to achieve on a regular basis in our sitting. One of the other cliches about sexuality that comes out, you hear it sometimes, like, I know how to be real slow and easy, baby, or something like that. I don't know how else to, you know, you hear that, right? Of course, that's talking about being so into it that you're beginning to go into the witness consciousness, into that sort of slow motion thing. What people don't realize is that in that state, you can begin to have detachment, okay, from the pleasure. So people, they start to get a little bit of that slow, easy rhythm, but then the grasping gets really, really strong. The trick is you get, or go all the way with that slow, easy rhythm. Pretty soon, it's like you're not there to have pleasure as an object anymore. You're there to use the energy and pleasure to transform yourself. And it's like everything gets real slow, and each wavelet presents itself in slow motion from beginning to end, and with it is this sense of deep fulfillment and this sense of renunciation. Not renunciation in the sense of abandoning or pushing away, renunciation in the sense of not spasming or tensing around it. Each one comes and passes away, comes and passes away, and you just feel that the depth of your being is being massaged, purified, transformed. Okay, so to do it, does it sound good? Maybe it doesn't even sound good, I don't know. It sounds good to me, okay? I can only share my own experiences. What does it take to do it? It takes intention, it takes determination, it takes huge sacrifice, huge sacrifice. At the beginning, because at the beginning you don't know that the non-grasping is going to make a deeper fulfillment. The non-grasping feels like you're going to lose something, but you have to be willing to pass through that sense of, you know, that sort of false sense of sacrifice. You know, there's a lot of talk about the so-called tantric sex and tantric yoga and whatever. Tantra in Sanskrit is not a Sanskrit word meaning sexual practice, okay? Tantra just means teaching. The same word as the Dharma just means teaching. But certain texts that had certain teaching often dealt with sexuality and Hinduism were called tantra, so then people started to use the word that way. There's a lot of talk about, and workshops and whatever, tantric sex and rerouting sexual energy and all of that. But if you're willing, if you have the renunciation of a celibate, then you can do tantric sexual practices, okay? If you don't have the renunciation of a celibate, then do your tantric sexual practices understanding that ultimately that's the stage where they'll start to work. But don't do the tantric sexual practices. I don't think anybody in this room does, but some people, it's just an excuse for a concept of some sort of souped-up sex, okay? You see what I mean? It's going to make the sexual experiences more intense or more special or more unusual, okay? You know, and some people will sell it in that way. You know, this is like a souped-up sex, you know, tantric sex, okay? What it is, is actually the ultimately cooled-out sex, you might say, but the ultimately fulfilling. How do you know if you're doing it right? Very simple. Watch day-to-day life. If you are experiencing spontaneous, effortless evolution in your ordinary behavior, then you're doing it right. Okay. Bill? Ah, yes, very practical. Actually, I'm very glad you brought that up. It was one of the things I was going to talk about. Okay, the question is, you know, what about your sex partner? Now, remember, of course, not every form of sex has a partner, but I mean, I was talking about every kind of sexual experience, but we're assuming a partner, okay, of some sort. Lots of possible partners, okay, especially in our day and age, right? Okay, meditating in the sexual experience is a specific case of the broader category of meditation in action, you might say, no gross pun intended, okay? Meditation in action, meditation in day-to-day life. Now, the challenge in meditation in day-to-day life is you have to go live in day-to-day life and be meditating at the same time. Now my metaphor, as you know, is always, well, it's like learning to drive a car. At first you can only drive the car, but then later you can do other things and drive the car. So obviously you don't want to have the fact that you're practicing meditation in your sexual encounters be something that is off-putting to your partner. Like you know, like, don't bug me now, baby, I've got to wait to get into this sensation or something like that. Now, it would be hard enough to do it, you know, if all you had to attend to was just the feelings in your body, that's enough, right? But you do have to attend to the feelings of your partner. At one level is you simply attend to the feelings of your partner as you would ordinarily. But a certain amount of energy and awareness, you're also attending in a meditative way to what you're doing. You're not just saying the things you would say and moving the way you would move. But you have the intention that the meditative awareness be there, just like you can talk to somebody. Many of you have practiced this, I've had you practice it in class, talking to people and keeping a meditative awareness while the conversation, the interaction is going on. Of course, if you can find a partner that practices meditative awareness, then you have just a wonderful circumstance, because then you're both in it and you can talk about doing it while you do it. And you can do it within that context and talk about your, you know, and interact on that level. So I would say basically there's just those two levels. You know, one is you don't want to ignore the partner and have your internalization interfere with your ordinary responses. But the second level is if your partner can be a practitioner also, then it's a perfect situation. Does that answer your question? Yeah, we'll have to practice. Other questions or comments? You go, Ma? Well, there is a lot of celibacy and monasticism in Buddhism. It arises from a number of causes. One has to do with the social and cultural background of Buddhism, because Buddhism arose in India, and in India long before the time of the Buddha, they had this caste system where everybody was in a rigid sort of framework. But then there had to be some sort of safety valve for the caste system. And what the safety valve for the caste system was, was something called sannyasa. And the person that takes or does sannyasa is called a sannyasi or sannyasin. Sannyasa is one of these great Sanskrit words. Sannyasa means to drop everything to the ground at once. That's what the word means, sannyasa, to throw everything down at once. Sannyasa is when you say, I give up everything, I am on the path to transcending conditionality, and you shave your head, you put on orange robes, and you simply walk around and people take care of you. At that point, you are out of the caste system completely. That is to say, you have no responsibilities whatsoever. On the other hand, you have no rights whatsoever. And people take care of you. In theory, practice meditation. You remain celibate, because you've given up everything. And that was the social setup. And Buddhism simply continued that social system. So although the Buddha taught many, many what we call householders, that is to say laypersons, not non-monks, and among his householders there were men and women, adults and children who had attained arhatship, were completely enlightened, and yet not monks and nuns. Many, many of them. Yet I think that that society was very much geared towards not really monasticism, because they didn't live in monasteries originally. It was more of a sacrifice than even a monastery. You just lived under trees and things and wandered around. So Buddhism took the social form of that culture. That's an aspect. The second aspect is, remember, ultimately, see if I give a talk and affirm sexuality, and I say, go for it, use sexuality, experience those pleasures in the way I've just described, then people will say, gee, it's really up to date, right? He's a great teacher. But if I give a talk and encourage people to renounce sexuality, then people will say, well, he's back there in the dark ages. But really, it's the same state of consciousness. You need the same state of consciousness. And there's two ways to get to it. There's a path of really fully experiencing sexuality, and there's a path of really fully giving up sexuality. But there's no in-between. I don't think there's an in-between. In other words, if you're celibate and even running daily type fantasies, it's not going to get you very far. It's got to be really, really clean, clean talk. So from that point of view, if your point of view is a transcendence, then why not be celibate? Plus, from the point of view of in running a large group of a sangha, a monastic order, you've got to have, especially in a country like India, which is so unhealthy anyway, you've got to have some sort of control on people's activities. So I think that was another practical kind of thing. I think from all of those perspectives, this is why that idea of celibacy arose. The danger, of course, is when you have people advocating celibacy, it is so easy either on a conscious or unconscious level that some value judgment implication starts to come in there that there's something not so spiritual about pleasure. And something more spiritual about the absence of pleasure, which is nonsense. Nonsense. That's why that distinction, sensation is one thing, reaction to sensation is something else. Pleasure and pain are one thing, craving and aversion are something quite distinct. If there's an enemy, it's craving and aversion. But even you can't start hating your cravings and aversions because that's more aversion than craving, right? Gee, I crave freedom from craving, but gee, I hate the fact that I have so much hate in me. What do you do? Well, it seems like a bootstrap situation. How do you pull yourself up? Just watch. You just watch your cravings and aversions coming and going. Nature will do the rest. Anyway, I think that there is that subtle thing that can get in there, sort of like monk is good, householder is not quite as spiritual. Makes no sense. But it does creep in there. So what do you do? You just watch. Be careful it doesn't creep in. But also be careful that hatred of monks and nuns doesn't creep in on the householder's part. Like, well, they're putting us down, or whatever. Okay? Does that give some? Okay, yeah. Well, when you say if you are celibate but you're running the odds of fantasies you're not going to get very far, how does one deal with the fantasy that arises spontaneously? Watch it. And, okay, but then that's... And let it be. Let it happen. Let it be. Don't interfere with it. And that's not an interference with the celibate state. No, that's correct. So actually, thank you for asking that question because it forced me to state more clearly. If you are intentionally running fantasies and buying into them on a regular basis, then celibacy is... Well, it may work for you eventually, but it's not working at that time. If unintentionally, though, you're sitting and stuff comes up, you don't want to stop that from coming up. You want to... Even if you're on a very celibate path, I would say some people might disagree, okay? But in my experience, if you're on a path of renunciation, celibacy, and you have endless material coming up, if you can watch it, watch the images and the sensations, the images and the sensations, images and sensations, images and sensations, if you can watch it in a meditative way, then you're purifying yourself. So that's good. And don't try to stop that kind of thing from coming up. But if you're buying into it, which we tend to do, then the job's not getting done. But maybe it'll get done someday. As far as thinking goes, from my point of view, thinking is just one of the six senses. And since vipassana is pouring heightened awareness into the six senses, if thinking is taking place, you just want to be aware of the goings and comings of thinking. I don't think that thinking is in some way different from hearing or body sensation. Somehow meditation... See, I guess we're dealing with a certain implication that the meditative state is a state where there's no thought. And I would just say that the meditative state is a state where there's heightened awareness and decreased grabbing. But I wouldn't necessarily say it's a state where there's no thought. I would say that what we're trying to do in meditation is not stop the mind, but break our addiction to thinking. In other words, you want to get down to the root habit, which is that thinking is an addictive process. In other words, the criterion, am I in meditation or not, is not the presence or absence of thought. Because you can have a... I mean, okay, I sat here for two hours before this talk began. In that period of time, there was not a single gap in my thinking process. In other words, I had thoughts constantly for those two hours. But that's because my object of meditation was thought this morning. I was watching thought. And there were incessant thoughts, but each one came as a wave and passed. And I would say I had a great meditation this morning, but there was not a single moment when there was not some mental image going on. On the other hand, as the result of having done that, if I were to decide I'd like to spend some time without thought, it's going to be much easier now, because some of the addiction to thought was broken by observing it. So that's what I would say, just with respect to that one little thing you brought up about the thought.
