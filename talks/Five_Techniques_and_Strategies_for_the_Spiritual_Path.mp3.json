{"text": " I am Stephanie Nash and I am interviewing Shinzen Young, who is a senior mindfulness meditation teacher in the United States and Canada. And, oh, you're going to be doing a retreat soon in another country, aren't you? Israel. Shinzen is known for his innovative and contemporary approach and reframing of Buddhist techniques, and among his most well-known recordings are the Science of Enlightenment and Breakthrough Pain. And there is a book's worth of articles on his website, www.shinzen.org, if anybody would like to read some stuff. And you're also working on a book version, I believe. Of the Science of Enlightenment. Yes. Cool. All right, so I have one main question, the answer to which will probably be our whole interview. So you can just play with it and have fun at it. Very good. You have many techniques aimed at investigating our experience, which cultivate sensory clarity and equanimity and not to mention concentration. And at this past retreat that I attended of yours, you organized these techniques in a way that I found to be particularly helpful and relevant to our daily lives. You put them into five basic categories, inside, outside, something you call rest states, impermanence, and with the fifth being loving kindness. And I wondered if you could talk about these categories and how your techniques fit into those and what you've done and why. I think that will be the focus of this interaction. But do feel free to actually interact. I will. I will. Because I'll be taking off my own little discourse here. I'm actually very pleased with this concept. One of the struggles that I've had over the years has been, as you mentioned, to find a completely contemporary formulation for Buddhist practice that does not lose any of the spiritual depth and liberation potential of the traditional practice, yet at the same time is completely abstracted from the cultural matrix and the doctrinal sort of religious system of Buddhism. So in other words, to sort of extract the heart of the thing, put it into fully contemporary language so that it can be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy, for pain management, for addiction recovery, all sorts of gateways that are relevant to modern people, yet it still has the power to enlighten and liberate. So that by using these techniques for a specific application, they find that they're drawn into something broader and deeper that can eventually culminate in enlightenment. So that's sort of like the task I set myself. I experimented year after year after year after year with different vocabulary and so forth. Finally, I found a list of 14 really powerful words that can be used to describe our experience, both as a language for the individual to understand what they are experiencing, and also a language with which they can communicate to others about their experience. Most human beings are, I say they are, alexithymic. This is a fancy word in Greek. It actually is a specific diagnosis in psychiatry, but the literal meaning in the Greek is, a means without, and lexicon is words, or a group of words, and thymos means your experience, your feelings, and so forth. So most human beings are unable to communicate with each other, and so they experience, and so forth. So most human beings are unable to be precise about what they experience subjectively. Everybody in that sense has alexithymia. They are without an accurate vocabulary for subjective experience. So over the years, I think I have hit upon the most empowering concepts and created a contemporary vocabulary for those concepts with regards to how to analyze your sensory experience in general, specifically your subjective experience of thought and emotion. So that took many, many years to formulate, and that alone gave me a lot of fulfillment, but there was one piece missing, which is, okay, now that I've got this, how do I present it? How do I parcel it out? How do I package it and describe it so that the average person can make use of this? So I think I have solved sort of my final barrier. There were many, many barriers just recently with the basic techniques that you alluded to. So I'm very, very pleased about that. Each of the techniques, I call them, well, I have working names for them. I haven't decided what we're going to officially call them, but right now I call them Focus In, Focus Out, Focus on Rest, Focus on Impermanence, and the Loving Kindness. That's five, isn't it? I've got all five. So each of these techniques is relatively simple, could actually be described to somebody in half an hour, and they are intuitive in the sense, not in the sense of psychic intuition, but intuitive in the computer programmer's sense, that sort of obvious. It's obvious what's involved, it's obvious how it could work, and so forth. So another synonym for intuitive is straightforward. So they're relatively simple, they're straightforward, such that the average person, meaning someone without a lot of intellectual background in things like meditation or psychology, the average person can see themselves doing each of the techniques. So they have that characteristic of being simple and straightforward, and each one of them simultaneously fulfills three distinct functions. So it's very clever what's built into these things. When you do each one, you learn a few vocabulary items for a lexicon of self-awareness. That gets parceled out. So when you're done with all five, you have all the terminology that I have found to be most productive for people to acquire. So it's a way of becoming eulexithymic, meaning now you're very good at understanding what you're experiencing, you have a conceptual framework. So you can acquire the concepts and vocabulary of self-knowledge. That's one of their functions. The second function is they function as general exercises that develop the basic goals, the basic long-term goals of mindfulness practice. The way I conceive of it, I always compare mindfulness practice to physical exercise. If you keep up with physical exercise in the long term, changes will take place in the fabric of your body. It will get stronger, it will get more flexible, it will become better defined, and so forth. So if you do mindfulness practice in the long term, you will discover something analogous to being stronger. You will elevate your baseline of concentration power, which I define as the ability to attend to what is relevant in any situation indefinitely for as long as you want without being distracted. So that's obviously a very important skill. You'll develop concentration power. You'll also develop something that I call sensory clarity, which is the ability to keep track of what you're experiencing moment by moment in terms of basic sensory qualities. And then there's another quality of consciousness that we call equanimity, which is the ability to let sensory experiences come and go, arise and pass away without on one hand suppressing them, and without on the other hand locking onto them. So this non-suppressing, non-locking, a kind of non-interference with sensory experiences, equanimity. And it turns out that concentration, clarity, and equanimity are of fundamental importance in the endeavor of any kind of endeavor that is a growth modality. So mindfulness can be an aid to any growth process. So those are the long term goals. Each of the five basic techniques serves as an exercise to develop the basic goals of concentration, clarity, and equanimity. So on one hand they develop an awareness of this vocabulary for your experience. At the same time they develop these basic skills as a kind of exercise. And the third role is that each of the five basic techniques serves as a basic strategy for dealing with situations. So that when somebody comes to you and they have a specific situation in life that they need to deal with, you can describe five fundamentally different contrasting and at the same time complementing approaches that they could use for dealing with that situation. So those are the three functions that each of the techniques fulfills simultaneously. It equips you with a vocabulary of self-awareness. It equips you with concentration, clarity, and equanimity. And it equips you with a notion of strategy. If such and such is going on, oh I have strategy options. I can do this, I can do that, I can do this other thing. If one doesn't work, well it's because of a certain cause and one of the other techniques will address that cause. That's what I mean by the complementarity of them. So it's sort of clever how it fulfills all those functions at the same time. For example, let's say that somebody comes to you and they are experiencing challenging emotions. It could be fear, it could be grieving, it could be an anger issue, it could be that somebody betrayed them, it could just be general emotional upset. So someone comes to you and they are experiencing challenging emotions. And they have never meditated and they don't have much self-awareness, they've never looked at themselves, they've never done any self-awareness tests. They have this problem and they would like some help. So you can tell that person, okay the experience that you're going through of this emotional challenge involves three subjective sensory experiences. You have disconcerting mental pictures, you have negative talk in your head, negative tapes, and each one of those triggers uncomfortable emotional flavors in your body such as fear, sadness, agitation, shame, and so forth. And then you ask that person, do these categories make sense? And they either do or they don't. If the person doesn't understand what you mean by these words, then you elaborate further until they're clear about what the terms refer to. And you tell them that we'll call any and all visual thoughts image. We'll call any and all auditory thinking talk. And we'll call any body sensation that seems emotional in nature, feel. Once they understand the nature of their sensory experience, you can say to them something like this, there are two ways that we can work with the challenge that you're facing. And I'm going to teach you both ways of working. One, we can focus on the challenge. We can actually monitor the mental images, the internal talk, and the emotional sensations in your body. But in a way to separate them out into manageable pieces so that instead of multiplying together, they just add together. And also in a way to develop a kind of sensitivity so that they can't sneak up on you and ambush you. So we're going to develop your antenna to detect the feel image talk. We'll call the body sensation that seems emotional, feel. And then the mental pictures image and the internal conversation talk. So we're going to develop your antenna to detect the feel image talk so it can't ambush you, sneak up on you, and you're doing something before you realize the thoughts and feelings that are driving that behavior. And also we're going to at the same time teach you how to separate those elements. And what's the advantage of separating them? Then they merely add together. If you can't separate them in awareness, they multiply together. Meaning if you don't keep track of the component parts, it hurts more? The overwhelm is more. I see. If each one is, if you have ten units of negative mental pictures, ten units of negative talk, and ten units of uncomfortable feel, if you keep track of it, separate it with awareness, you have ten plus ten plus ten. Most people can't keep track of it, so they cross multiply, giving the impression of ten times ten times ten. So when the person says I'm completely overwhelmed and my fear or my grief or my rage is at level one thousand, in reality that's an illusion. It's only at level thirty. So a thirty pound weight you can handle. It won't overwhelm you. A one thousand pound weight will certainly crush you. So that's the purpose for the, so the separation achieves a reduction in overwhelm in that sense. And when you said sneak up on you, you mean when they're present but you're not aware of it? When the feel image talk arises and you don't detect it clearly, then you will find that your actions have been distorted by them. Everybody has had that experience. Something comes up, you say something or do something, and then in retrospect you say, why did I do that when what I really needed to do was this other thing? The reason is because some combination of feel or image or talk ambushed you. It arose in consciousness, you didn't detect it. It influenced your behavior before you were even aware that it was there. Every human being has that experience, every human being has had that experience to their chagrin many, many, many times. That's because of lacking training in the antenna to detect when this stuff is arising. So one strategy, the focus on strategy, trains two things. It reduces overwhelm by teaching how to separate it into feel image talk into manageable pieces and it also reduces inappropriate behaviors by teaching, developing a sensitivity to them so that you can detect when they activate and you're aware of them before they have hijacked your behavior. The focus on strategy we'll call focus in, in this case, meaning you're going to focus in on the feel and the image and the talk. You're going to name them. If you're aware of feel, you say feel. If you're aware of image, you say image and so forth. One way that we can work together, this is how you're talking to the person that has the problem. One thing I can teach you is we're going to focus on the thoughts and feelings themselves and we'll call that strategy focus in because we're focusing on your internal state and we're going to track the feel image talk so that it won't overwhelm you and also won't hijack you. By way of contrast, the focus away strategy, well, we have several possibilities. One possibility is I can teach you how to detect naturally occurring pleasant restful states. That sounds nice. Yes. The advantage to working with the pleasant restful states is that they create a kind of container of equanimity within which the negative emotion can come and go without so much identification. One advantage for working with the restful states is that even though we're not focusing on the emotion itself, the negative emotion, in a sense we're working with it because we're using the restful states to develop a container of equanimity within which the negative emotion can come and go without interference and therefore without you having to identify with it or be so caught in it. The other advantage to working with the restful states is that as you learn more about them, they become a self contained sensory pleasure system and fulfillment system that you can access anytime you want. The more you focus on them, the more intense they get. Are these states that we are creating or states that are always present, just the tuning in to them? The restful states occur naturally. Most people don't know what to look for or when and where so they don't detect them but they're constantly there during the day. We'll just teach you how to detect them but we'll also teach you how to enhance them, how to make them more prominent. It's sort of like tuning into a faint radio station. Yes, that's a good metaphor, which then becomes not so faint as you learn to tune into it. With high tech equipment. Yes, high technique equipment. High technique equipment, there we go. It's sort of a mixture in the sense that they are naturally occurring and are there but also we'll show you ways to make them more prominent. The focus on restful states is an example of a focus away strategy. We're not focusing exactly on the field. We're focused away from the negative emotion on to something, in this case that's pleasant, that has several advantages. It creates a container within which the negative can come and go but it also creates an internally contained source of fulfillment that you can access any time you want, 24-7. Can you give me an example of how it can be a container? For equanimity? You said it was a container of equanimity in which we can watch the feeling arise? Well, actually you won't, in this particular case you wouldn't watch the feelings arise but they would be able to arise. One of the restful states is physical relaxation. That sort of opens the body so if you have uncomfortable emotions they can come and go through the body and there's less resistance because there's less tensing. For example, that's one of the restful states. Another restful state is the blank mental screen. Even if you have mental pictures there's always a kind of pleasant darkness, brightness and or brightness behind your closed eyes and you could ignore the mental pictures and focus on that and that's intrinsically soothing. The mental pictures just sort of come and go but you're looking around them and through them onto the screen and that creates a container for thoughts, at least the visual parts of the thoughts to come and go without interference. There are actually four other flavors of restfulness and I could describe how each one fulfills this. Once again, speaking to the person who has come to seek help, on one hand you can focus in and work with the challenge itself. On the other hand you can focus on rest which would be one way of focusing away from the challenge but in a way that doesn't suppress the challenging emotion but does reduce your being caught in it. I will call that focus on rest and that's a second possible strategy. There's yet a third way that you can focus away from the challenging thoughts and feelings. You can focus out, by that I mean focus on external sights, external sounds and physical type body sensations. We'll call physical type body sensations touch in contrast to emotional type body sensations. Many people find that if they focus on external sounds that will pull them away from the internal sound of their self-talk. If they focus on external sights that will pull them away from the internal sights of their disconcerting mental pictures or negative memories and so forth. If they focus on the physical side of their body that will pull them away from the emotional side of their body. Because physical touches, external sights and external sounds are always in the moment whereas feel-image-talk may be in past or future or fantasy and so forth but touch, sight, sound are always in the moment. Because of that the touch, sight, sound becomes an anchoring or a grounding strategy that helps you once again be less caught up in the feel-image-talk and also helps you be in the present moment if you're having a lot of difficulty being lost in the past or in the future or in the world of fantasy and daydream. Focus out on the touch, sight, sound can be very helpful. There's a book that a lot of people read that has this million dollar title. It is such a great title. It's called The Power of Now. It is true. There is a power to now. It's absolutely true. How do you access the power of now in a tangible way though? How do you go about actually finding, experiencing the power of now? Technique wise if all you're aware of is physical sensations say touch. If all you're aware of is sight say sight. If all you're aware of is sound say sound. If more than one of them is available just choose one to focus on. As soon as you find yourself pulled into feel-image-talk come back to touch, sight, sound is a tangible procedure for accessing the power of now. We'll call that focusing out because it's external relative to the subjective world of feel-image-talk. Can I imagine the tangibleness of it makes it easy? That's part of the power. The power of the power of now is in the tangibility of touch, sight, sound as opposed to the illusory nature of feel-image-talk. That's yet another focus away strategy. So far we have you can focus away on the restful states and that's intrinsically pleasant and creates equanimity for this container of equanimity. You can focus out on the touch, sight, sound and that fulfills something similar but in a different way. Accessing the quote power of now. The touch, sight, sound might not be as intrinsically pleasant as the restful states but it also has a certain power and a certain grounding aspect to it. Probably more neutral although there could be pleasant or unpleasant in it but it isn't connected to a story necessarily. The story that it's connected to is called the reality of the moment as opposed to your personal story. It's the universe's story is touch, sight, sound. You could say that touch, sight, sound might be called if we look upon God as consciousness or a mind, the human mind, the human psyche has feel-image-talk. The cosmic psyche has touch, sight, sound. In other words the so-called material world is sort of the mind of the cosmos. It is interesting how it's made of the same sensory elements. There's a whole school of Buddhism, my school actually, Shingon, that looks upon it that way. Looks upon touch, sight, sound as it deifies and says it's a pantheistic system. It says that this is the consciousness of the cosmic Buddha. The human consciousness has feel-image-talk. The cosmic Buddha's consciousness is the touch, sight, sound of this so-called material world. That's a whole other little riff we won't go into. So we can focus away onto pleasant restful experiences. We'll call that focus on rest. We can focus away and anchor in touch, sight, sound. We can focus on the feel-image-talk itself. We'll call that focus in by way of contrast to the focus out on the touch, sight, sound. We focus in to the feel-image-talk. There's two other strategies that represent a focus away from the problem strategy. That gives us the last two techniques. We can apply a focus that emphasizes how things constantly change. How they move and when they disappear. Assuming that you're able to detect that. Sometimes it's possible to detect how things change. Things meaning any and all sensory experience. The touch, sight, sound or feel-image-talk or the restful states. Sometimes show you their impermanence aspect. They don't solidify. They move. They vanish. You're able to detect that. If that's the case, that becomes yet another focus away from the problem strategy. You're now focusing on how things change. Including how the problem, the sensory challenge changes. Your emotional challenge that you came to me with. There could be constant change within the feel-image-talk that represents the emotional challenge that you came to me to deal with. In that case... By constant change you mean that my feelings get more bigger and smaller? They increase or decrease in intensity. Their shapes shift. Their qualities shift. They vanish. When you listen to the talk it's suddenly gone. You look at the image and it evaporates or melts and morphs. The sensations become undulatory, vibratory and so forth. The feel sensations. It could happen that in the sensory challenge itself or in touch, sight, sound or in the restful states that qualities of change become very prominent. In that case if you focus on change you're just aware of the change. You're not so caught up anymore in the emotion or whatever it may be. This represents yet another way of focusing away from the challenge. But it's sort of interesting because if the impermanence is in the feel-image-talk you might say in a sense you're focusing on the challenge but you're focusing on how the challenge is changing and therefore less and less is it a thing called a challenge and more and more it becomes simply a kind of vibrating space. So we'll call that focus on impermanence. And when you're saying focusing on how something is changing I just want to clarify. You don't mean that it's now this much more or this much less. You mean that it's changing at all. That there is change happening? Any sensory experience either sits there and is completely stable and doesn't change in any way at all in terms of size, shape, quality or it changes. If it's perfectly stable fine that's part of nature but sometimes it's not perfectly stable and the more you tune into the small changes the bigger the changes get. It becomes a kind of feedback loop. The more you are sensitive to change the more change appears there until finally it goes from being a noun to being a verb. It goes from being a thing to a kind of pure doing and it breaks up into a shower of energy and expands and contracts space. Is it really changing or is your perception changing? Well the it is your perception in this case because the only thing that we're dealing with is sensory experience here. This is not an endeavor that makes any statement about the nature of physical reality. This touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk are sensory experiences. You remember that the claim was that we're increasing your concentration, your sensory clarity and your sensory equanimity. So the it is sensory experience. The it is not what is objectively there because that's a whole other question. The it is what is there in the senses. In other words phenomenology. What appears to be there is what we're working with. Mindfulness is a science of sensory experience not a science that makes claims about objective reality at least in my way of looking at things. So the it is the perception. So perceptions sometimes solidify and sometimes they flow and vanish. As you begin to notice how they flow and vanish there is a tendency with time for that aspect of the experience to become more and more and more prominent. It just happens automatically. In other words the senses modify as you are focusing on impermanence. The impermanence becomes more prominent. You're not trying to make that happen. That's the interesting thing. And a person might ask well why if you focus on how things change initially they don't change much but the more you focus on how they change they change more and more and more. A person might ask why is that true. And I think it's true for several reasons. First of all they probably were changing all along you just didn't have the sensitivity to detect it. But there may be other things involved. They may actually literally change more as the result of having observed them even though having them change more is absolutely not the agenda and the practice. The focus on impermanence you only do if you notice impermanence. You don't implement that strategy if everything is absolutely stable. So it's not like we're going to do something to make the things flow. But the fact is they will tend to become more impermanent as you work with them. Well part of that is probably that you're simply noticing the impermanence that was always there. Part of it is when you bring equanimity to things because that's part of it. A piece of it is the equanimity as well as the sensory clarity. When you bring equanimity to things you're not interfering with them. You remember the definition is not pushing them down but also not locking onto them unnecessarily. That probably is the equanimity is responsible for them becoming more fluid. So the heightened sensory clarity allows you to detect the impermanence that was there that you didn't notice. But the equanimity actually makes the things become more fluid. But the equanimity is just accepting what's there though. As a byproduct of accepting what's there, what's there becomes more pleasantly flowing energy which is sort of an interesting paradox. But a nice one. Yes. Isn't it nice that it works out that way. Now there is probably another factor which I've actually never talked about in public and I've never heard anybody else talk about which may be entering in here. Which is that the freezing of the senses moment by moment actually cuts down on the amount of information that can pass through and be processed. So that there's an evolutionary push to unfixate the senses because the senses operate more efficiently if they're flowing. So you're literally getting more information. Yet holding on to it for a shorter time. So that the senses become richer and yet less of a something paradoxically. Your sensory experience becomes both richer and more vacuous at exactly the same time. But that's a whole other thing. And it's a paradox. So there may be a natural tendency, an evolutionary tendency because it's the job of our sensory system to process information. If you sort of give it half a chance it will evolve in the direction of flow because that actually represents the most efficient way to process information. So it wants to do it that way. And it's the opposite of the way everyone tends to tighten up and really hold on. This is an advanced topic. I never really discussed that. It's a conjecture on my part. So I thought since we're talking about it. Why not? Give some new context. So you can focus in on the field image talk. Separating it into manageable pieces and developing your antennas so that you can't be hijacked so much by it. That's one fundamental strategy. Another fundamental strategy, focus on rest. Focus away on these pleasant experiences that will give you an internally contained, self-contained source of sensory fulfillment. And in addition create this state of equanimity where the negative emotions can come and go without gripping you. Or you can focus out and anchor yourself in the present moment in the touch site sound which also creates equanimity but is a contrasting flavor of the focus away strategy. Or you can focus away onto the impermanence of whatever is going on if that's evident. So we call that focus on impermanence. And there's one final focus away strategy that contrasts with the other three. When you focus on permanence, when you focus on rest, when you focus and anchor into touch site sound, you're not intentionally creating something. You're going with what is there. It is also possible to decide to actively create positive feel, positive image, and positive talk. The ones that you have control over are the image and the talk. You can actively generate certain pictures and you can actively generate certain words in your head. Those will tend to then trigger pleasant feeling states. So you can actively create positive images and positive self-talk and be sensitive to the pleasant feel that that produces. And focus on that and ignore to the best of your ability the unpleasant images, unpleasant talk, unpleasant feel. And so this would be an active creation of something that counteracts the negative state of feel-image-talk. It's an active creation of positive feel-image-talk to militate against in a sense or hopefully even replace the negative feel-image-talk. And broadly we refer to this practice as loving kindness. Although the feel-image-talk that you may generate might not be always just love but it's something positive and intentional. That's another focus away from the negativity strategy. But in this case it's a replace the negative strategy. It's a replace the negative with a positive or at least neutralize the negative with a positive that you actively create. What's the difference between that and just having a fantasy, pleasant fantasy? That's a pleasant thing that you're putting in instead of... Yes, excellent question. A pleasant fantasy is the internal analog of watching a pleasant TV show. Yes, it is. You're right. In other words there's nothing wrong with watching TV and there's certainly nothing wrong with running a pleasant fantasy. People do it. But I would refer to this not as a growth strategy but as a distraction strategy. The fantasy. Or watching TV. So focus away is not the same as distract yourself. Not at all the same as distract yourself. There's a difference in intention and there's a difference in implementation and there's a difference in effect. A distraction strategy, watch TV to distract yourself, run an internal fantasy to distract yourself. The intention is to distract yourself. A focus away strategy, the intention is to develop concentration, clarity and equanimity. So there's an intention to train consciousness. An analogy with exercise. Passive exercise doesn't build muscles. I can lift your arm up and down lots and lots of times, your arm won't get any stronger. You have to work against a resistance consciously and your arm gets stronger. You watch television, the distraction just happens. You're not developing a concentration power that is a change in the fabric of your consciousness. It's passive exercise. You run a fantasy, anybody can do that. You're not getting any stronger in consciousness by doing that. So the intention in distraction, either external distractions or internal distractions, is to distract. The intention in one of the four focus away strategies, focus on rest, focus on touch, sight, sound, focus on impermanence or develop loving kindness. The intention here is not to distract. It's to develop concentration, clarity and equanimity. Is it important that you keep track of where you are feeling the loving kindness or whatever other positive emotion? That's the clarity piece, which piece is which. And you come back to it when the negative pulls you, that's the concentration piece, and you work hard. And you are consciously aware that by doing this it's creating that environment of equanimity. Because the intention differs, the implementation differs, you're using a technique. Therefore the effect will differ. If you distract yourself, then you distracted yourself. It's like a drug. It's okay. Hopefully it anesthetized you. But then when it wears off, you haven't grown. So that was a really good question. So to use the example of someone coming who has an emotional issue, and say for example you clarify that they're having this feeling in their chest that's an emotional feeling we'll call feel. And they're having an image of an event that disturbs them. And they're having internal talk that's judging themselves. And so if we wanted to do a loving kindness practice to make sure that it was not just a distraction fantasy. Yes, what you would do is, you would first of all allow that negative feeling and stuff to be there. Not try to suppress it, because then you'd be working against yourself. But you would try to call up a positive image and focus on that. And then when you got pulled into the negative, again create the positive. Same in talk space, you have some control over talk space. And you would also try to notice that the positive image would have a more pleasant impact on your body. The positive talk would have a more pleasant. And then you keep selectively bringing yourself back to the positive. Trying to give as much real estate in consciousness over to the positive. Understanding that a certain amount of the real estate will be occupied by the negative. But also understanding that there's only a finite amount of real estate in consciousness. And so if the strategy works, then gradually the positive will sort of, not suppress, but it will just sort of squeeze out the negative. The negative won't have as much room. It won't have lebensraum. It won't have... Like a plant gets more light, it's just going to grow bigger. It won't have room to work, to be there. Now, of course, the focus away onto positive strategy, the loving kindness, may or may not work. The focus away and anchor yourself in the power of now, in touch, sight, sound, the focus out strategy, may or may not work. The focus away onto restful states strategy may or may not work. The focus on, in other words, focus on and attend to the feel image talk strategy may or may not work. However, because the five strategies are so contrasting, in other words, so fundamentally different, and because if one of them doesn't work, the other ones will tend to address the reason that it didn't work. So one of them... Has a very high probability of working eventually. Also, because they're different, they'll appeal to different people. One person will... Always like to do the power of now. They'll like one or they'll like another one. And also because they're different, it's possible to keep your interest up. Because if you sort of get numbed out with one, there's this other thing that's really so different. It's like a meal with five different dim sum keeps your interest as opposed to like the pizza that tastes exactly the same bite after bite after bite. And they all have the effect of building sensory clarity, sensory equanimity and concentration. Exactly. Because they all develop the same qualities, in a sense it doesn't matter which one you use, so you don't have to make a big deal about which one you choose. But based on interest, opportunity or necessity, in other words, what you think personally is interesting, so that's the interest piece, or what seems to want to open for you, which is an opportunity, like if there's flow there, that's an opportunity. If there's a lot of impermanence, flow and vanishing, that's an opportunity. Hey, let's focus on that. If it's easy to access restful states, that's a window of opportunity. Let's go for that sort of thing. So depending on interest, your personal interest, opportunity, meaning the opportunities nature presents to you, and then necessity. You might want to focus on rest, but the feel-image talk is so loud, you just can't. So necessity now dictates that you focus on to the sensory challenge. So depending on your interest and the opportunities nature presents to you, and the necessity, what you can do, given what you're going through, you make an initial choice of one of these five very different strategies. Focus in and monitor and clarify the subjective world, focus out and anchor yourself in the objective world, focus on rest and find self-contained fulfillment, focus on impermanence and understand the wave nature of sensory reality, or loving-kindness, where you understand how you can create your own sensory reality from scratch. You choose one of these based on interest, opportunity, necessity, and you're off and running. And if I'm giving this to someone who's come to me, I let them choose, or they can let me choose for them based on my thoughts about what might work. But I prefer to give the client the opportunity to choose because it vastly increases the probability of success, and of them being interested and wanting to do it. And it empowers them as a person that they can choose which of these ones they start with. Now, they'll implement that and it will work to some degree. If it works well, great, just stay with that. If it works sort of okay, well, maybe stay with it or maybe try something else. If it really doesn't work, there'll be a reason, and we choose one of the other four techniques to address that reason. And by work, you mean? Very good that you asked. It has a very, very set meaning. A technique works if it has one of the following effects, one or more of the following effects. Reduces your suffering, elevates your fulfillment, gives you insight into who you are, helps you change behaviors that you need to change, or fosters a sense of a calling to be of service to your fellow humans. Those are the five general goals of the spiritual path as I conceive of it. We have a body, and the body has pleasant touch and unpleasant touch, it has pleasant feel and unpleasant feel. So we would like to experience the unpleasant touches and unpleasant feels with less suffering. Pain is unavoidable, but the suffering is optional. We would like to experience the pleasant touch and feel with real fulfillment. Pleasure can always be gotten. Fulfillment is not necessarily guaranteed. How many shoes will fulfill you if you don't know how to be fulfilled with one? How many pairs do you need? The Imelda Marcos phenomenon. If you ask anyone on the street, they're fulfilled. I don't know. How many? Well, it won't depend on how much money they make, I'll tell you that. That's for sure. It won't depend on their sense of fulfillment. If you look at the wealth and power of human beings, there are some human beings that literally have a million times the wealth and power of another human being. I promise you, they are not a million times happier, or a thousand times happier, or even necessarily two times happier, or even necessarily as happy. Because if you don't know how to derive fulfillment from pleasure, then you might as well be utterly impoverished. We have a body, so we want to, as I say, pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional, but people don't know that. So we want to reduce suffering. The practice works if it's reducing suffering. Pleasure can always be gotten, but fulfillment is not guaranteed. We want to increase fulfillment. The degree of suffering with pain and the degree of fulfillment with pleasure depend on clarity, equanimity, and so forth. So much for the body. The mind wants answers. It wants answers to this and that, but then it wants answers to the real question, what am I? At the personal level, the structural level, and the sort of essential spiritual level. If you're getting answers that are insights into who am I, especially at the deeper levels, then the technique is working. Behavior changes, everybody has things they're doing that they would best stop, and things they're not doing that they would best take on. No kidding. That's behavior change, and the techniques should help with that. Most people may not realize it, but innate in all human beings, if they reach a certain point of spiritual evolution, they will contact this innate desire to be of service to their fellow being. If the techniques help you get in contact with that. In other words, for me, I want less suffering, more fulfillment, the knowledge of who I am, and I want to change my behaviors. I want that for me. You know what? I want that for everyone else too. That want that for everyone else too is an important piece that we call in Buddhism bodhicitta, or the bodhisattva orientation. But also, it's not unique to Buddhism. Our shamanic ancestors, our pre-literate tribal societies, when they would do their vision quest and whatever, they would see all of humanity, and they would know that they had a calling to serve, and that's how you became a shaman. So this is intrinsic in the human experience. It's not unique to Buddhism. The bodhicitta of Mahayana Buddhism and the shamanic vocation of our remote ancestors don't seem to be the same, but if you talk to people that have experienced this, you'll see that it's exactly the same, just formulated in a different cultural milieu. So we know that these things are working if they elevate fulfillment, diminish suffering, help us make behavior changes and understand ourselves at the deepest level, and not just for ourselves, but all of the above for others. So now let's look back at the territory we've covered. I think you'll agree that these five exercises are fairly simple and intuitive. Once you've learned them all, you understand the meaning of the following words. Touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk. Touch, sight, sound is your outside world. Feel, image, talk is your inside world. There are six restful states. We talked about two of them, relaxation, blank. But there's four other significant restful experiences like mental quiet, emotional peace, sort of open, defocus way of working with external sights and the ability to detect the silence around you. So you have relaxation, light, silence, peace, blank, quiet, six restful flavors. And you also know the meaning of flow and vanishing, which are the impermanence flavors. So this gives you a vocabulary. Those are the 14 words. Those are the 14 magic words. And at an advanced level, there's two other words that are added, which are the fundamental flavors of flow, expansion and contraction. And with those 16 words, you really have it all in terms of what is important, the empowering distinctions, both for psychological and spiritual awareness, self-awareness, knowledge. So by the time you learn these exercises, you have an experiential knowledge of what that vocabulary means. And you have a kind of scientific awareness of your own experience in general, sensory experience. And most importantly, you have a kind of science of subjective experience. Your emotions, your reactions, your will and desire and urges, both positive and negative, can only come up as patterns of feel, image, talk, activation. And now you have words for this. And when you have the words, you have the power that goes with that, just like the scientist has the words force, energy, action, impulse. With those words come incredible power. So you can see that they do impart in manageable doses a vocabulary, a lexicon of self-awareness. Each one of them is an exercise that develops the basic long-term goals of concentration, clarity, equanimity, which are good for everyone. And at the same time, now that we've gone through it, you can see that it's an intuitive system of strategy options. Oh, you have an emotional challenge. Well, you can focus in on the feel and the talk. You can focus out on the touch, sight, sound. You can focus on rest. You can focus on permanence. You can focus on loving kindness. Each one of them has X, Y, and Z payoff. Each one of them might involve a P, Q, and R challenge. You choose where you'd like to start. And if it doesn't work, well, one of the others probably will. And if none of them work, just keep cycling through until one of them does. Because inevitably, if you're willing to stay with it, one of them will work. And now we know what work means. Very clearly what work means. That was really good that you asked me to elucidate that. What's interesting is that not only does this system of basic techniques incorporate both vocabulary learning and consciousness exercises and response strategies, it also turns out that they represent both the initial and final stages of all of the major Buddhist ways of practicing that developed over 2,500 years of history and spanning half the world. The focus in, where you separate your subjective experience into the elements of feel, image, talk, is a contemporary reworking of the original Buddha's discovery, divide and conquer. He used the five aggregates. He said if you analyze your experience into these five aggregates, you'll see there's these five aggregates, but there's no thing called a separate self. So it's divide and conquer. An emergent property called separate suffering self disappears when you're able to see the underlying components out of which it's made. The same thing happens when you work with feel, image, talk. The emergent property of a suffering separate self disappears and you just have feel plus image plus talk. When feel mixes with image, mixes with talk, you have a sense of I am a limited thing called self. So the early Buddhist divide and conquer strategy for seeing quote no self is represented by the focus in strategy. Another early Buddhist strategy called the absorption states is represented by the focus on the restful states. It's not identical to the absorption states of early Buddhism, but it's sort of my version of that. So that's two initial practices of the early Buddhist initial practices of break self into its components, which is the classic vipassana, and then the sort of get into these deep restful pleasant things, which is the classic shamatha. That's early Buddhism in a form of Mahayana Buddhism that developed in East Asia called Zen or Chan in Chinese. Your initial practice with Roshi will often be in the form of koans such as when you chop vegetables, how do you become free? When you hear the temple bell, how do you become free? When you see the flower, how do you become free? When you drive your car, how do you become free? These initial koans are asking you to let go of the feel, become free of the feel image talk subjective world and merge with the touch sight sound objective world. So that's the focus out strategy incorporates that sort of beginning of the Zen piece. And then the loving kindness strategy, because it works specifically with image and talk and body sensation incorporates influences from the tantric or Vajrayana tradition, where you replace your ordinary feel image talk with archetypal feel image talk. Although the loving kindness is done in early Buddhism also, where the emphasis is on phrases and emotions in the body, there's a way of bringing the image piece in and that can potentially give it a spin in the direction of what's called deity yoga, which is the initial practice in the secret initiations of tantric Buddhism. The way that I teach loving kindness can either be valence towards the early Buddhist practice of loving kindness, or it can be valence towards the latest Buddhist practice, which is this deity yoga that they do, for example, in Tibetan Buddhism, where you're visualizing yourself as a deity and so forth. You could do it that way, you have the option to do it that way if you want. And so it brings in at least potentially the initial practice of the tantric or Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, which is the later one. So you've got the small vehicle, the large vehicle, and the diamond vehicle practices. Initial practices are there in the focus in, focus on rest, focus out, focus on loving kindness. What's interesting is each of those practices, remember I said these were initial practices that developed historically in Buddhism, each of those initial practices always culminates in the end in a dissolution into flow and vanishing. Okay, all roads lead. All roads lead. You may begin by deconstructing into the five aggregates, but then you see that the five aggregates are just made out of empty space, and you're aware of constant vanishing, vanishing, impermanence, so it goes in, it ends up with flow and vanishing. The absorption path, you get into these blissful, deep, restful states, but then you see that they're just made up of vibrating space. You penetrate the absorption states, and you end up with flow and vanishing. The Zen master might initially ask you to merge with Tutsite sound, but in the end he's going to ask you to realize that Tutsite sound, feel, image, talk, the external perception of a surrounding and your internal perception of a self come out of the activity of impermanence and return to the activity of impermanence moment by moment. So it's going to end up with flow and gone, and specifically it's going to end up with simultaneously expanding, contracting flow that then flatlines into vanishing, and that's the activity of the source, at least according to the way my Zen teacher, Sasaki Roshi, teaches. Your initial koan might be, you know, just see the flower, but your final koan is the Tutsite sound of the flower and the feel, image, talk of the seer of the flower coming out of emptiness and returning to emptiness through the activity of impermanence. So it ends up in that place. Although that would be your words, he wouldn't say Tutsite sound. No, no, he would just say self and world. Okay, but I am making it a little more user friendly and a little less inscrutable by saying, oh yeah, and by the way, what he means by self is your subjective world of feel, image, talk. By the way, what he means by so-called external world is still sensory experience, Tutsite sound. So yes, I've made it a little more contemporary, but you're right, he would not have formulated it quite that way. I brought that in to make it perhaps a little bit more like Vipassana. It loses the inscrutable flavor of the figure pointing to the hazy moon, Zen style, but I'd rather people understand. And then Vajrayana practice, where you have this deity yoga, that's called the Jherim or the stages of generation. But then the next thing after that is the Dzogrim or the stages of completion, where the whole thing you use different yogic practices and you have this experience of the oneness of bliss and void. Everything breaks up into energy, flow and vacuity and the visualized deities and whatever all go back to the emptiness. And so that ends up in exactly the same place, but with use of special yoga things to get the flow, but then the vanishing is the vanishing. It's all seen as coming from emptiness and returning to emptiness. So in the path of completion in Vajrayana, once again, you end up with focus on impermanence. Because I include in impermanence not only the movement, but the vanishings. And the vanishings are the emptiness, the empty nature of things, the vanishing of the shunyata, the nothingness of the source. So that these five techniques not only are a way of learning a lexicon for self-awareness, they're not only exercises that develop the most fundamental skills of concentration, sensory clarity and equanimity, they're not only fundamentally differing strategies for dealing with situations, they also incorporate within them the entire spectrum of Buddhist practice, but in a languaging that is so contemporary that unless you really look carefully, you never realize the vast underpinnings that are beneath them.
