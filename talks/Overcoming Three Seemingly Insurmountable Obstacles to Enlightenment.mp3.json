{"text": " All over the world, in every spiritual tradition, in every age, there have been individuals that went beyond the superficial spirituality of their times and came to a realization that transcended their limited identity. As you may be aware, we tend to identify or say, I am, with respect to our ideas and body sensations. In other words, our thoughts and feelings. Have you noticed that? Isn't that where we live? We say this is what I am. We're creatures basically of thought and feeling. One of the things that has been discovered in the Buddhist tradition is that feeling can be tangibly accessed by paying attention to any and all sensations that arise within the body. And that takes us down into what is called the Vedana Khanda, which is the feeling core of our being. Animals live there. Babies live there, at that feeling core that knows pleasure and pain. All human beings still have that feeling core, but surrounding that they have a thinking surface. So ideas and body sensations is where we live when we say, I am. Nothing wrong with ideas and body sensations. And in fact, nothing wrong with abiding in ideas and body sensations. Where the problem comes is if that's the only place that a person can ever abide and say, I am. Which is the situation for 99.99% of our species. So there is another relationship to the flow of ideas and body sensations, which is a relationship of sometimes I'm this, but I'm not limited to it. And those that have achieved that relationship develop a completely different paradigm about a completely different model about what they are, what the world is, time and space, and about the source, the source of those ideas and body sensations and the source of the world, the universe, time and space. As I said, in every age and inside and outside of every spiritual tradition, there have been individuals that have achieved or come to realize or just spontaneously, had it happened to them that this new relationship to the flow of ideas and body sensations became real to them. There are many ways that a person can cultivate that new relationship. And one of the ways that is particularly appealing is the path that involves two cultivated skills. One is a skill that in Buddhism we call mindfulness, which is the ability to be precise and clear about the components of one's experience moment by moment. And the second is a skill that we call in Buddhism equanimity, which means an attitude of openness or non-interference with the flow of those senses. These are skills that can be developed the way muscle can be developed by systematic exercise. This is one path. It is the core of the early Buddhist practice, which is known by the name vipassana. But you'll find that these two practices exist outside of Buddhism. People that would never consider themselves Buddhists or never heard of Buddhism will talk about this, but in different words. Krishnamurti talked about choiceless awareness, or in the Gurdjieff tradition they talk about being awake, waking up, this kind of thing. What is appealing about this is that anybody can cultivate these skills and you don't have to become a Buddhist in order to develop mindfulness and equanimity. So you can realize, you can practice the hardware without necessarily buying into the software, you might say. There are people that follow this path that even practice with Buddhist techniques, but consider themselves to be Orthodox Jews, or there's even any number of Roman Catholic priests and nuns that do it. They're still Catholic. They still accept the software of Christianity, the ideas by software, I mean the philosophical perspective. But they have developed the hardware, the actual mechanics of the mindfulness and equanimity using Buddhist techniques. So it's very appealing because it's systematic, it's step-by-step, therefore it's relatively easy to teach, and it allows people to have quite a bit of freedom as far as their belief systems go. However, if you follow this path, the path of mindfulness and equanimity, there are some challenges that come up, and some of those challenges are more difficult to deal with than other ones. And today I wanted to address some of those challenges. But before I do that, I would like to remind everyone that as you're listening to this talk, ideas are arising as the result of what I'm saying. Some of those ideas are conscious, some of those ideas are semi-conscious, subliminal, subtle processing. And in response to the whole situation of being here, feelings are arising, again, some of them quite obvious and conscious, some of them perhaps very subtle and subliminal. Feelings are arising instant by instant from the sounds and the visual impact of this talk. If I say something that's interesting, that's useful, pleasant sensations arise. If I say something that doesn't make any sense, doesn't compute for you, the unpleasant feeling of confusion arises. If I say something that you violently disagree with, the unpleasant sensation of irritation arises. And if you get bored, the unpleasant sensation of sleepiness arises. You'll start to fidget. Why I point this out is that in the very act of talking and listening about this path, it is useful to cultivate the habit of practicing the path. My teacher, Joshu Sasaki Roshi, sometimes says, in order to understand my talks, meaning his talks, you have to listen with your belly button wide open. Now, that's a Zen teacher's way of talking. What does he mean by that? Listen with your belly button wide open. You know, it's not like opening your ears, right? He said, open up your belly button and listen to what I have to say. That's a center of understanding that's way far deeper than what's between the ears. In other words, don't be so concerned instant by instant in attaching meaning to what you hear. Be concerned instant by instant with mindfulness and equanimity about your own ideas and body sensations arising in reaction to what you hear. And what will happen then is, amazingly, even though instant by instant you may not be so attached to figuring out what the teacher is saying, afterwards something has impacted deep, deep down in the core of your being. So I would encourage you very much, those of you that know how to practice mindfulness and equanimity, to be aware that each sentence that I speak to you today is a burst of sound, and that burst of sound, with each transition in the speech, there is a new arising of yourself as ideas and body sensations in reaction to what you hear and see, and in reaction to the situation here. And if you can be precise and allowing with respect to that instant by instant changing sense of self, then you will be in the optimal situation to appreciate a talk about these topics. As I mentioned, in a sense the principles of the Vipassana practice are very simple. One has this thing called experience, and one attempts to cultivate a precision and an openness to experience. And one attempts to cultivate this with consistency, and that word consistency is very deep and very important. If one can remember the principle of consistency, then a lot of the difficulties that arise in the course of this practice can be overcome, can be dealt with. Let me tell you some of the challenges that a person has to pass through in order to go from the surface to the source, in order to go from the top of consciousness down to the activity that gives rise to consciousness. It's interesting, in certain traditions of Jewish mysticism, the mystics were called yaredim, which means the people that descend, not descend into the hell realms, but they descend from surface to the source. Usually people tend to think of mysticism as an ascent, a climbing of a mountain, and perhaps that metaphor is useful, but for me it's much more of a penetrating, a journey downwards from surface to source. In that journey there are challenges that are encountered. Some of them are difficult, and some of them are seemingly impossible. Amongst the difficult challenges, the first thing that most people have to face and come to grips with is the tendency to substitute something for actual practice. That will wipe you out right there. That's a mortal blow right there at the beginning. What do people tend to substitute for practice? They tend to substitute intellectual study and discussion. Not that there's anything wrong with those things, in fact those things are exceedingly useful, but not when they become a substitute for putting the tush to the cush. People tend to substitute belief and a related phenomenon which I call wishful thinking, airy-fairy. How many times have you heard in the new age, it's all perfect, it's all just as it's meant to be? It sounds nice, okay, but those ideas can become a substitute for a tangible experience of the perfection. So the next time somebody with a new age consciousness says something like, it's all perfect, remember what the litmus test for that philosophy is. You have to be able to find the perfection in your root canal therapy. You have to be able to find the perfection in a pain that's so intense that you can't remember the idea that everything is perfect. You can't even remember who you are. Remember there are pains of that intensity where you can't even remember who you are, what to say of remember who God is or the perfection of things. So where's the perfection then? That experience of the perfection of things cannot be wishful thinking or blind faith. That has to be something that's really tangible. So one of the biggest challenges that people face is that they find reasons not to actually do the exercises that will develop the mindfulness and equanimity that will allow them to have real experience, material, tangible experience of the source, as opposed to the vicarious experience that comes through intellectual understanding and through belief. That's actually perhaps the most dangerous of all challenges, because it wipes you out right at the beginning. Basically you'll never take the journey. You'll read the guidebooks as that substitute, that's the substitute for taking the journey. Or you'll argue about the guidebooks for years. Oh, this one says this is the way to go, and this one says this is the way to go, and this Vipassana teacher says this is the way to go, etc., etc. Amongst the difficult but not impossible challenges that a person faces, the first and foremost of course, and most of you have had intimate experience with it, is the fact that it's very hard to develop concentration. When you sit down to meditate, your main experience is your mind wanders. You try to pull it back, your mind wanders, you try to pull it back. And it can be very frustrating to people, and it can go on for quite a while. Many years you have to struggle with that phenomenon. I can only say that the frustration that you feel at your inability to be focused and concentrated is part and parcel of the learning process to become focused and concentrated. If you weren't experiencing the pain of the scattered state, there would never become the motivation to develop the focused state. So a person has to understand that that's part of the learning process. And also understand that it takes, you've had how many years and decades of the habit of being scattered, and you've had how many minutes and hours of the practice of meditation. So you're dealing with an enormous retraining of consciousness. And it's not just you as an individual. You may have had years and decades of being scattered, but behind you are centuries, at least centuries, probably millennia, of in general your ancestors and everyone around you being scattered. That's why the Buddha referred to the path of enlightenment as swimming against the stream. There's a stream of human conditioning, which we, I guess you might say in the Christian metaphor, we inherit the sin of Adam. Our species has been scattered for at least a couple thousand years, if not longer. I suspect that in tribal times, 10,000 years ago in terms of Europe, people didn't, life was much simpler and the activities were much more focusing and life was harsh, which tended to drive people into states of concentration. I don't know how long this addiction and hypertrophy with respect to thinking has been going on, but probably several millennia at least. And we've got all that, and then you've got all the millions of people on this planet that have no concept whatsoever of the most important thing for any human being to know, which is that the very consciousness which will achieve anything can be honed in terms of its focusing abilities. So they try to achieve all these different things without ever being willing to spend the time to sharpen the axe. And then they wonder why the trees aren't being cut down very efficiently, and why it seems to take a lot of effort and sometimes you can't cut them down. In general, you've got, you know, what, a billion people, most of them very unfocused, living at this time, and you've got all your ancestors behind you. That's a huge force of conditioning in the direction of scattering. What to say of your own personal life? Like the indomitable salmon that can swim up seemingly impossibly against these cataracts, we have to swim against that stream of the habit of scatteredness of our species. And that's a big challenge. But with time, with effort, and with support, that can be overcome. That's just a matter of time, effort, and support. What I'd like to address today are some challenges that seem to be insurmountable from a logical point of view. The challenge of the scattered mind is not something that is logically insurmountable. It just takes time and effort and support, encouragement. But there's some challenges that come up in this practice that seem to be invincible from a logical point of view. You seem to be asked to do something that cannot logically be done. It's not just a matter of lacking strength. It's a matter that the problem itself is seemingly invincible or insurmountable. Let me give you an example of what I mean by that. In general, we do things for rewards. And in general, the deeper your practice gets, you do get rewards. However, it can happen that in certain phases of your practice, the deeper you go, the worse things get. Now where's your motivation to practice? This is very difficult. In general, the deeper you go into a state of relaxation, if you have physical discomforts in your body, let's say, the deeper you go into relaxation, the deeper you go into what we call Samadhi, the easier it is to put up with that discomfort. And in fact, it tends to sort of dissolve or not bother you so much. But there's certain kinds of yucky sensations that can come up for no apparent reason. You know, sometimes a lot of people get it in the legs and their legs shake, but it's sort of like, it feels like, and those of you that have this experience, you'll know what I'm talking about. It feels like your skin's crawling, like your bones are itching, like you just can't stand to sit there for a second. You just want to jump out of your skin. Your blood's boiling, okay? It's what in Yiddish is called spilkas, okay? Some of you know this word. It's like pins and needles all over you, okay? And the more you relax, the worse it gets. It's not like the other pains. It's not like the aches and pains from the posture. The more you open it, the more you relax, the more unbearable it seems. And that's a very difficult thing to overcome, because you're not getting, you seem to get a punishment for going deeper into meditation, not getting a reward. And that's like logically very difficult to overcome in your mind. But let me give you some encouragement for this particular kind of challenge. Be happy when you get those kinds of pains, because those kinds of pains are pure impurity. Now you may think I'm talking complete nonsense. What does he mean by pure impurity? That's an oxymoron. That's a contradiction in terms. In this case, the impurity is resistance, or what we call aversion, or congealing. Ordinarily, resistance doesn't come up in a pure form. It comes up mixed with something else. With what? Something to resist. There'd be a strong pain. In general, the stronger the pains, the more the resistance. So if you have a pain of level 10, you resist at level 10. If you have a pain of level 100, you resist at level 100. Unfortunately, the subjective experience of suffering is in some ways the function of both how much pain there is and how much you resist. Therefore what happens is when you have pain of level 10, you resist against it at level 10, and so the pain times the resistance is 10 times 10. You get an experience of suffering at the level 100. Actually, there's only 10 units of pain and 10 units of resistance. But when your pain jumps from level 10 to level 100, you tend to resist at level 100, and therefore your suffering is 100 times 100, or 10,000. So what happens is that when your pain increases by a factor of 10, unfortunately your suffering increases by a factor of 100. Some of you may have noticed that phenomenon where it's like it's bearable, it's bearable, it's bearable, and suddenly it's not bearable at all. It's just gone to a whole other level. So what's happened is actually there's only been just another increment in the pain, but because it's now, it's multiplied with an increment of resistance, suddenly it's gone from being 100 to being 10,000, and it just seems utterly unbearable. So in any event, what happens when you sit and meditate is that you get the blessing, the wonderful experience, even though you think at the time it's a horrible experience, you get the wonderful experience of resistance of level 100 coming up without any pain of level 100 to interact with. It's just pure impurity, pure resistance. There may be pain of level 10, or pain of level 1, and you're reacting to it with a resistance of level 100, and that's why you get those icky things. The characteristic of this kind of sensation is it doesn't really hurt, but you can't stand it. If in your practice you get the experience, it doesn't really hurt, but I can't stand it, understand that's good, that's primo, that's high quality, that's what you want to get, because that's pure impurity coming up. The problem is though, the more you relax and open up to it, the worse it gets, seemingly, because you're just opening yourself up to level after level. So you don't seem to be getting a reward, you seem to be punished for going deeper into meditation, and that kind of phenomenon is very difficult to deal with on a logical level, unless you remember what I just mentioned. And then you'll be happy when that phenomenon comes up, and you can work through it. Of course, you'll always remember what to do if you remember the axiom of consistency. Before it comes up, you consistently observe it with detachment, including the phenomenon of the deeper I go in meditation, the worse I feel. Even that phenomenon, you consistently observe. But for many people, that becomes invincible, because they can't logically get over the fact, if you follow what I'm saying, that it doesn't make sense. Why should things be getting worse the deeper I go? Another seemingly invincible challenge that a person faces on this path is they lose faith in themselves. You know, there's this book called The Last Temptation of Christ, right? It was made into a movie. Do you know what the second to the last temptation of the Buddha was? There was a last temptation, and there was a second to the last temptation. I'll tell you what the last temptation of the Buddha was, the very last, was after he got enlightened, he had the thought, this is so deep and so difficult to convey to people that I shouldn't even try. I'll just abide and I'll understand it for myself, but it's just, it's not going to work. People aren't going to be able to catch on. So it was a temptation not to teach. But then he had the thought, but at least some people will understand, and it's worth it. I don't know if you're aware, the Buddha was fully enlightened at a very young age, relatively, 35. And he lived to a very old age for those times, 80. It's 45 years of teaching that he walked back and forth throughout northeast India, spreading what he had learned, and it wasn't easy. It was not easy. People didn't understand, people were threatened. He was a radical. He definitely, totally threatened the orthodox society of his day. His ideas went, in some ways drew from Hinduism, but definitely went against the orthodoxy of Hinduism. And people were pissed off, and people tried to get him, and did all sorts of dirty tricks on him. It was not easy. So his last temptation was not to teach, but his second to the last temptation, before he actually attained enlightenment, was, I'm not worthy to become enlightened. I'm not good enough. Some of the Buddha statues show the Buddha in what's called the Bhumi Sparsha Mudra, which means the touching of the earth gesture. And after he had that temptation, according to legend, he touched the earth, and the earth shook to bear witness to his self-worth. So you may have, at some time, it may come up for you, yes, the practice is good. I can see it's important, but I can't do it. I'm not good enough. I'm not disciplined enough. I'm not this enough. I'm not that enough. When that comes up, that comes up as ideas and body sensations. I'll never get enlightened. I can't get enlightened. Maybe my teacher is a little enlightened, but I won't be able to. When that comes up, that's an idea. It expands in the mind and then fades, and then once again expands in the mind and then fades. And associated with that are feeling tones that well up in different locations of the body and then fade. The axiom of consistency in this practice dictates that you will observe even that idea, even the idea, I can't meditate. I'm not good enough. I'm not disciplined enough. I can't do it. This won't work for me. Even that. If you remember the axiom of consistency, you can overcome that obstacle. But it's a seemingly invincible obstacle, because it's the obstacle that says that there's no sense in trying to overcome any obstacle. I can't do it. Remember the axiom of consistency. It's interesting. I and another American Buddhist teacher and a Zen master, Japanese Zen master, the three of us were once interviewed for Japanese television. It was an interview in the Japanese language. And the guy that interviewed us was a very interesting guy, I really enjoyed him, I'd never met him. His name is Rocky Aoki. Yes, that's really his name. Do you know who he is? He's the guy that started the Benihana chain. All those restaurants. But he's sort of a celebrity in Japan. Sometimes celebrities take English nicknames. He actually did a very good job of interviewing us and was very sympathetic and knew how to interview Buddhist monks. At one point he asked the question, what is enlightenment? There was the three of us. There was my friend Dai Zen here, who's sitting here, and me, and then Maezumi Roshi, the Zen master from the LA Zen Center, was here. That was the Roshi. And it's like, he asked Dai Zen, what's enlightenment? And Dai Zen looked at me, and I looked at the Roshi, it was really funny. We were both definitely going to pass on that one. You have to leave that to the senior. And he said, I forget the exact words, but it was something like, pause for a moment, and he said, something to that effect. Oh, what does that mean? It means, well, I think you could say that it is the passing away of the distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment. A very interesting answer to the question. So how does that distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment pass away? One way that it passes away is by seeing that the very thought, I'm not good enough to meditate, I'm not enlightened, I can't get enlightened, that very thought arises and passes away within the folds of expansion and contraction, within the flow of impermanence. It comes from enlightenment. If you observe your own conviction that you're not enlightened long enough, then you will literally see that that very conviction has as its substance enlightenment itself. It's made out of the activity of impermanence. And then the distinction between I'm enlightened and I'm not enlightened will pass away for you. And if that idea caused some confusion in your mind, then watch how the confusion wells up and passes away. So a seemingly invincible obstacle is, I'm not good enough, I can't do it, this ain't for me, I'm not enlightened, I'm not enlightenment material. Then watch that comes up in the mind and body. And if that's all that comes up for you for two or three years, then that's your homework assignment from the universe. Finally, I'd like to talk about one of the most difficult and seemingly invincible obstacles that comes up in this path. And this is a very advanced obstacle. It won't, it typically doesn't happen to people until they're well along in the practice. But I want to mention it to you because it has already happened to some of you, and those of you that persevere with this practice, that remember the axiom of consistency and keep consistently doing it, including right now, because some of you aren't. It will become relevant. What can happen after this practice has begun to be successful is you get real calm, you don't have that problem with the wandering mind anymore so much, you're real peaceful, and there's a sort of sense of oneness and connectedness which is wonderful. But you notice that your old motivation, the fire, the passion for life has waned, and your emotions have somewhat gone flat. It's very peaceful, it's very wonderful. It beats the old bullshit by far, okay. But it's rather disconcerting because as a result of success with this practice, something seems to now be lost. What I meant by the old bullshit, I hope I didn't offend anybody by that vocabulary, is that before you didn't really have what we would call motivation very much. What you mostly had was drivenness, and that goes away. Okay, compulsion, the drop, internal suffering is what was motivating a lot of your endeavors. Okay, well great, a lot of the internal suffering's cleared up, but now what about the passion for life's activities? That seems to have waned. It's hard to motivate yourself. It's like, it's all one, okay. That's the dark side, the shadow side to the oneness. If it's all one, it's hard to get passionately involved on one side or the other of things. And as I say, there's a certain flatness in the emotions. A friend dies and it hardly makes a ripple. And it's like, what am I becoming? What, am I losing my humanness? This is a very big obstacle, becomes very relevant, not for everyone, but for some people, because it seems to be a negative consequence, an actual behavioral negative consequence of the practice. The first obstacle I talked about as being logically very difficult, which is the deeper you go, the yuckier the sensation gets, that's a subjective difficulty, okay, that would discourage a person from going deep. But what I'm talking about now is objective, in your actual behavior, in your actual expression of things. Things seem to have gone flat. What to do about this? Again, the axiom of consistency, but this is hard, okay. Somehow you have to consistently observe that state of consciousness. Watch the thoughts and the feelings that go with that. And that becomes difficult because you might tend to think, well, the more I do that, then the things are going to get flatter and I'm going to get less human and less motivated. But I can assure you, I can promise you, that is not what happens. What happens is that you are going from being a thing to being a process. You're going from being a noun to being a verb. And there's an awkward intermediate zone that you have to pass through, where the human thing within you does in fact pass away. And what it gets replaced with is a very, very full human activity. How does that happen? It happens from several causes. One is that you don't give up the practice, but you consistently observe even those mind-body states. That's one cause. A second cause is that you take feedback from the people around you. If the people around you are telling you you're not doing your job, you're not being motivated, you're not expressing yourself, you're not acting in a human way, you listen. How does the baby learn? It learns through getting feedback from its environment, its physical environment and its parents. And it learns to behave. The no-self, which is arising within you, has to learn to take over all the activities that the self-self did before. And that's a whole process, just as when the baby is born into the world it has to form a self-self, and it does that by taking feedback. And then it learns to cope with the world. When you go from being an adult to being a super-adult, you have to go from being the self-self to the no-self. And the no-self has to learn all the stuff the self-self had to learn. It has to learn how to be motivated and do activities. It has to learn how to be feeling and expressive. Again it's like forming a personality, but this personality is made out of pure activity. The old personality was a material thing. It had an entity or substantial quality to it. It's like a whole process of being born again. But you're being born written, it's the same story, but it's being written with a different ink. It's a new substance, it's not a substance. You're being born as spirit. I know we talk about the spiritual path and it sounds great, oh yeah, I'd like to be spiritual. Take a shard of ice and you melt it, it turns into fluid water, and then you vaporize it. And that vapor is what in Latin is meant by spiritus. It's still H2O, but in some ways it's a very different critter. Vapor is in some ways a very different critter, not chemically different, but it behaves in a different way. So in the same way it's very difficult to convey, but what has to happen is that the pure activity of impermanence has to learn how to be a human being. The great Christian mystic Meister Eckhart referred to that as the birth of Christ within each person, the birth of the Son within each person. The way that that happens, the way that the motivations come back, and the way that nothing learns to feel, you become nothing, and yet you become a feeling nothing, and a motivated nothing. It seems like a total contradiction in terms, it transcends all logic. How can something without will or desire or feeling manifest passionately will and desire and feeling? The way it happens is that as you enter the void, number one, you continue to observe all states of thought and feeling as they come up, no matter what. The other thing is you take feedback from the people around you, you just listen. And pretty soon the no-self regains its motivations and it learns to be expressive and feeling. But as I say, it's like you can make a statue out of gold or you can make a statue out of lead. The statue may look the same, it could be exactly the same form, but the substance is different. So when emptiness, when impermanence, when spirit learns to act human, it's really human, it's like any other human. It has the form of the human, but the substance is different. The third thing that gets you through that emptiness is contact with people that have made it through. In my own personal case, if I hadn't had the living proof of an enlightened teacher in front of me that I could see, it would have been very difficult for me to make it over the pit of the void. By the way, this expression, the pit of emptiness, is a Buddhist phrase. I would look at Sasaki Roshi and that would give me the living proof that nothing bad was going to happen as the result of going into that emptiness. I remember vividly my first interview with him. The first interview is when you sort of officially become that person's student. It was something to the effect of, and of course there's a certain intimacy because again we're speaking Japanese and he doesn't get to speak Japanese with his students very often, so it was a real intimate quality to it. And he said, you've been a monk in Japan, you've been in this a long time, you know what this is about. I'm tired of these wimpy American students. I expect you to come to the point where you no longer need to make an object of the self or the world ever again. That's quite a trip to have laid on you. Listen carefully to his choice of vocabulary. Every one of those words was chosen as carefully as a mathematician chooses the words when they want to express some deep insight. That was the E equals MC squared of spirituality. Reach the point where you no longer need to make an object of the self or the world ever again. He didn't say, don't make an object of the self or the world. Okay. Very subtle distinction. He said, reach the point where you don't need to make an object of the self or the world. And what the heck does he mean by making an object of the self, and what the heck does he mean by making an object of the world? When the ideas and body sensations that produce the sense of self are experienced with less than perfect mindfulness and equanimity, the sense of self appears as a thing, an object. And when the six senses that produce the sense of an outside world are experienced with less than perfect mindfulness and equanimity, the outside world appears as a thing rather than as a flow. So you don't need to make an object of the self or world means that the compulsion to solidify the six senses into subject and object, into self and world has been worked through. It doesn't mean that you don't make an object of self or world, it just means that you don't have to. In other words, to go back to the thing I said at the beginning of this talk, all around the world there are individuals who have come to the point where their relationship to the sense of self, their ideas and body sensations, has gone from being a relationship of prison to being a relationship of a home. And if they don't need to make an object of those ideas and body sensations, when they experience those ideas and body sensations that produce the sense of self fully, then the sense of self doesn't exist as an object and they're not limited, they're not constrained to be only that. When I looked at him, when I'd watch him in day to day life, it was very evident just from his demeanor, from his body language, that he no longer needed to make an object of the self or the world. In other words, he had gone from being always a thing to only occasionally being a thing and mostly being an activity. And it was also very evident to me, two things were very, very evident. Number one, that his efficacy, his motivation and his ability to impact and get the job done was way beyond that of an ordinary person. And his happiness was beyond unbearable. So I had living proof that absolutely nothing bad would happen if I went into emptiness, because he was obviously there and he was obviously exceedingly dynamic and exceedingly happy and effective as a human being. So when you find yourself, if you should find yourself, facing this experience of the pit of the void, that is to say, as a result of your practice, everything's peaceful, there's a sense of oneness, but your motivations and your emotions are going sort of flat, I would suggest you keep three things in mind. Number one, the axiom of consistency. Observe that, even that. See the ideas and body sensations that come up as the result of that reaction to meditation. Number two, understand why it's happening and that it's only a temporary stage that you go through. When you bite into an apple, the first thing your teeth encounter is the skin of the apple. But actually, that's what the skin feels like, it's not what most of the apple feels like. In the same way, when you have your first experiences of no-self or emptiness, it may present itself as this sort of very flat, emotionally flat, sort of dehumanized and unmotivated state, non-dynamic state. But understand that's just, and it's not always that way, but it's that way for some people, that's just the skin of the apple. The main meat of emptiness is much more nourishing than that. So don't think that it's always going to be that way. In other words, understand it's a stage you pass through. And the third thing that may be helpful is to be in contact with people that have made it past the skin, okay, and are now really enjoying the meaty part, the rich part of emptiness. And that will give you some encouragement. You can talk to those people and you can also see by the way they live their lives that nothing bad will happen as a result of going from being a thing to being an activity. Nothing bad will happen. What will happen is that the drivenness gets replaced by dynamic behavior. So what you called motivation before, that's going to go, but a new kind of motivation will arise for you, which I contrast with drivenness, I call it dynamic. And the seeming flat emotion is just an intermediate stage along the path of your emotions being congealed to your emotions being like mist, okay. You have to go through this stage where they, you might pass through a stage where they sort of flatten out. But when they become mist, then they become really vibratory again, really complete, really elastic. You're feeling, I don't know how else to put it, you may wonder what the heck I'm trying to convey. But if you think of the difference between what happens when you, you know, between a piece of wood and a piece of rubber, okay, the so-called elasticity of the rubber. Most people, they say they're having emotions or feeling, but it's actually very wooden. And what happens is the more liberated you become, the more elastic and rubbery your feelings become, more bouncy they become. And the other thing is, take feedback from your environment. Take feedback, listen to everyone, okay. If they tell you you're not responding in ways that are appropriate, let the no-self hear that, and it will learn. It will, it will, it will process that feedback. And how does the baby learn how to walk? It falls to the right, it falls to the left, it makes a mistake in this direction, it makes a mistake in that direction. And when it falls this way, it gets feedback, okay. Oh, I put too much weight that way. When it falls that way, it gets feedback. Eventually it learns how to be balanced. That's how the self-self learns. The no-self learns in exactly the same way. It's mistakes. If it's willing to listen to the ordinary people, its environment, then it will learn from those mistakes, and it will become a healthy no-self. You might think it's hard enough just to enter the no-self, but that's only part of the challenge. The other part is to develop a healthy no-self, because there's a whole range of no-self experiences from totally pathological to super healthy. The whole range. And there's a lot of in-betweens. But that is another topic. I don't want to get off on that. So just to briefly review what I talked about today, there is a universal path, a perennial philosophy found in all times and all places. People that have gone beyond their limited identity. Scholars of religion refer to them as mystics. Not every saint is a mystic, and not all mystics act the way we think saints should act. One way to get there is through the path of mindfulness and equanimity, or put in other vocabulary, attentiveness and openness. To what? The flow of ordinary experience. But in order for the attentiveness and openness to work, there has to be a certain critical mass of it. A little bit won't do much. You know what I mean by critical mass? A little bit doesn't do much, more doesn't do very much more, but at a certain point there's enough that something really dramatic takes place. And in order to develop enough, one has to remember, in addition to the mindfulness and equanimity, the importance of consistency, consistency in terms of daily practice, consistency in terms of regular retreats, and consistency in terms of whatever comes up as a reaction to your practice. Consistently have mindfulness and equanimity with that. And I wanted to specifically talk about three reactions to the practice that seem invincible or seem, from a logical point of view, to be very difficult to consistently observe. One is the phenomenon of certain kinds of yucky sensations that get worse the deeper you go in meditation, so you get punished for deepening your practice, seemingly punished for deepening your practice. A second is a lack of faith in yourself, which can just logically wipe you out, because if this practice isn't for me, I can't do it. I mean, I don't have the discipline. That's an idea. I'm not good enough. That's an idea. Whatever comes up that undermines your faith that you could become just as liberated as anyone, comes up as ideas and body sensations. That can be consistently observed, and that can be seen through, and then the distinction between enlightenment and unenlightenment will pass away. And then the third is this phenomenon of the more you meditate, the more dehumanized you feel and the less motivated you feel. And how to understand that, put that in context, and a few tips on how to deal with it. It seems like picking yourself up by your own bootstrap. It doesn't seem to be possible to do. But these things can be gotten around.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.52, "text": " All over the world, in every spiritual tradition, in every age, there have been
