{"text": " Sometimes when I perform marriage ceremonies, I like to say relationships are the householder's monastery, the householder's ashram. In other words, we have two situations that we can go into in order to deepen our spiritual life. One is called a monastery, or in the East it's called an ashram, and the other is called a relationship. Now, of course, there is a difference. In order to make a relationship into your monastery, you have to have a strong intention to do so, and you have to have an idea of how that would be done. When you go into a monastery-monastery, that's all set up for you. But since most people in most cultures do not make their relationships a monastery, a place of spiritual practice, although they may give lip service to it, they don't actually do so. I'd like to talk a little bit today specifically about how you do that. Those of you that are familiar with vipassana meditation probably already know what I'm going to say, because what we learn when we do vipassana meditation is a generic approach. That is to say, it's applicable to all situations. So relationship is a situation, and if you know the generic approach of vipassana, you will know what I'm going to say, how to meditate within the situation of the relationship. But let me review for you, because it's always useful to remember the fundamentals. What is this generic approach, this universal stance that we call vipassana meditation? Right now, what's happening? Sounds are happening. In response to sounds, ideas are happening. You're listening to words. Body sensations are happening. It's hot. That's a body sensation. Somebody's scratching. That was a body sensation. Every time the body moves, there was a sensation that preceded that. As you're listening, are you aware the gears are turning back there? The mind is working. Thinking is happening, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to what I'm saying. And vision is happening. In addition to that, there may be smells and tastes from time to time that happen. These are our six senses. Right now, this is what's happening. It's what's always happening. In addition to the fact that we have these six senses, however, another exceedingly significant fact is our relationship to these six senses. Most people have a relationship of nebulosity and friction. Nebulosity means cloudiness. We're not crystal clear, moment by moment, of how these senses come and go. Thoughts arise and pass away without us knowing they've arisen and passed away. Qualities of feeling rise and pass away without us knowing where in the body they were exactly, without us knowing what their qualities were or how their levels of intensity changed, not knowing specifically. The lack of specificity and awareness is characteristic of our relationship to these six senses. And I call that nebulosity. It's cloudy. The other thing that is characteristic of our, and by our I mean our species, the human species relationship to these six senses, is that without even knowing it, that's the tragedy of course, without even knowing it, there is subtle friction in the flow of these six senses. We only start to know it when that friction starts to break up and our senses start to return to the effortless, just happening quality that we find so refreshing in the way ripples spread on a lake or the way the wind moves through the leaves. Only when these six senses start to return to their natural, more fluid state do we realize all along how much instant by instant subconscious congealing or friction, viscosity, there had always been in these six senses. So most people have a relationship to experience of tighten up and turn away, a relationship of congeal and go unconscious, an inability to keep specific contact moment by moment with the components that are these six senses, the components of self and world. Right now the self and the world is arising, most assuredly. How is the sense of self arising, certain ideas and body sensations are arising. How is the sense of world arising? Look this way, light strikes the eye. Look this way, a different pattern of light strikes the eye. The eye, the back of the eye is being caressed by radiant electromagnetic energy. We call it seeing, but it's actually a direct touch on the body. That's how the world is arising. In response to hearing and seeing, ideas arise in the mind, thoughts arise in the body, and they give us the sense that there's a self back here that is doing the hearing and seeing. To the extent that we have a relationship to experience of being aware and not interfering, to that extent the experience is deeply and unconditionally satisfying. To the extent that we have a relationship to experience characterized by congealing and lack of precision instant by instant in awareness, to that extent experience is a very limited thing. It's a kind of prism. We are trapped in a certain place, in a certain time, in a certain identity. So that when our relationship to experience changes, then we find that our sense of identity is profoundly impacted, and we don't feel limited. We don't feel like we are encased within time and space and constrained to identify with just one mind and just one body. This is what we mean by liberation. So meditation, at least in the Vipassana tradition, Vipassana is one out of three Buddhist traditions, the other two being Zen and Vajrayana. And Buddhism, of course, is one out of many worldwide traditions of enlightenment. But at least as far as the Vipassana tradition goes, this one particular technology of enlightenment, our job is to retrain our relationship to these six senses, to experience, to train it into a relationship of contact and non-interference. So whenever the senses arise, if we make an attempt to be precise in our awareness, and if we make an attempt to not interfere with the flow of experience, we may have to interfere with the flow of events, push and pull on people and circumstances. That's called for often. But pushing and pulling on the macroscopic flow of events is one thing. Pushing and pulling on the microscopic flow of these senses is something quite different. And unfortunately, what happened to our human species is because we developed an ability to push and pull on the macroscopic flow of events, we also developed, without even knowing it, an instant-by-instant tendency to be pushing and pulling on the flow of our own senses, developing something like friction inside the senses that causes these senses to congeal into what the ordinary sense of time, space, and self. But this can be trained away. So whenever we make an attempt to be precise about the coming and goings of the senses, and whenever we make an attempt to not interfere with the comings and goings of the senses, then we find that we are training ourselves to this healthier and more satisfying relationship to experience. Now we can do this within any situation. But certain situations are particularly productive or particularly challenging. The most productive and most challenging of all situations to cultivate this skill is the situation called relationship, having a significant other. One has to do basically two things in order to successfully, quote, use a relationship as a monastery. The first is that one has to constantly associate the relationship in one's mind with the spiritual path. In other words, you know how you can create arbitrary associations? Like you can decide that something is going to mean something to you, a certain thing. You follow what I'm saying? Like for example, I had an interesting experience many, many years ago when I would appear on television. And the first time I went to a TV studio, it was like, you know, I was pretty nervous, and the TV studio was like, you know, it was this place I had to go, and there was a lot of lights and a lot of chaos and a lot of uptightness and a lot of hurry, and you know, it was just a big job being in a TV studio, because you know, you're looking into this camera and you realize more people than you'll ever meet in your entire life are looking at you. You're looking out at a million people that are just hanging on your words, okay? And it was like this really big uptight situation. And then as I was doing this more, you get more used to it, and you're less uptight. And one morning as I was going to this studio, I had this sense that this TV studio was a cathedral. It was this church. And everybody in the church was like choir boys or deacons or something. All the technicians in the studio and everything were working so that one thing could happen, which is that I could reach out and give this message that was going to be helpful to people. And it's like my whole concept of what a TV studio is changed. And it started to have this association that some people would associate with their place of worship. And that really was a very interesting thing for me, because it showed me that any situation can mean anything you want if you decide it to. And it can build up. And now it's like every time I'm in a radio station or a TV station, that association is strengthened, and it's like constantly there for me, you might say. Well, a person in their mind has to constantly be conceiving of the relationship as a church, as a temple, until when they see the other person or they think of the other person, that association is just sort of automatically there, the person they're having their relationship or they think about going home, any interaction with the companion, the significant other, has this association that's very strongly built up that this is my monastery. Now in a monastery, you have all sorts of symbols to remind you of that. And you may wear special clothes to remind you of that. In a quote secular relationship, you have to strengthen those associations, and it takes a lot of work. You have to create them from scratch, so to speak. But you know how there's certain people that you just meet under a certain context and that person is sort of imprinted with a certain association? Well, a person needs to imprint their significant other with the association, this is my spiritual monastery, kind of thing. So that that's there and it becomes second nature. I said there's two things. The second thing is that one has to be constantly having the tools of meditation present, because you can never tell when you're going to be called upon to use them in the relationship. You never want to be caught off guard, so to speak. In a monastery, therefore, what you have is a kind of symbolic environment, and then inside the monastery you have a feedback system that's constantly reminding you to be practicing meditation, reminding you to have your technique ready. Because in a monastery, chances are, what do I mean by a feedback mechanism? Well, basically what it is, is a monastery is a very uncomfortable place to live, physically uncomfortable, psychologically uncomfortable. You may think, if you've never lived in a monastery, that it's a place that people go to to withdraw and escape from things. But actually, it's a place that people go to in order to be able to confront things in an environment that's skillful, that's helpful for that. That means it's basically an uncomfortable place. And therefore, you get this feedback mechanism, which is that if you're in a meditative state when you're in the monastery, the discomfort doesn't bother you. Conversely, as soon as you're bothered by the environment of the monastery, you know, ah, I've left my meditative state. So you get this constant feedback loop going on. That reminds you to have your tools of meditation at hand at all times. Otherwise, you're going to start to suffer. In a relationship, it's not quite that way. So you need to, unless your relationship's getting really bad, in which case, then that will be quite evident. You as a person have to decide that you're going to have the tools always there. Now what do we mean by the tools? Well, right now, you're sitting here, you're listening to me talk. Some of you are meditating, some of you aren't. The tools means that if those of you that are meditating, it means that you have a defined object of meditation. It may be your thoughts, it may be your body sensations, it may be the comings and goings of the sound, it may be the whole sensory field. You have a defined object of meditation. And while the events of life are going on, you are infusing that aspect of experience with the qualities of attentiveness and allowingness. Now at first, when a person learns how to meditate, they can only meditate left alone on a cushion. The idea of being able to intentionally meditate in the flow of daily life is inconceivable when you first start your practice. You don't think you'll ever be able to do it. But if you spend enough time doing formal practice, these skills go on automatic pilot for you. And you're able to maintain an intentional meditative state while doing the ordinary activities of life. So probably for me, the most productive object of meditation in relationship would be body sensation. Now remember, when we talk about body sensation, the so-called emotions are, in my way of thinking, a tangle of two senses, ideas tangled up with body sensation. So the feeling part of the emotion is body sensation. However, most people don't look at it that way. They think that the emotion is in the mind somehow. There's a reason for that. That's because since most people don't have much what we would call resolving power or ability to detect subtle sensations in the body, when they attend to the body, like if they're going through anger or if they're going through grief or if they're going through fear or anxiety, even mild anxiety, you ask them to tell you what they're feeling in the body, they'll say, well, I think I have a little tightness in the throat or I think I have a little shaking in my arms. That's the tip of the iceberg, the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Tip of the iceberg means that there's part of the iceberg exposed to consciousness. But as you go down the sides of the iceberg, you realize that the deeper you go, the larger the iceberg is. And yet you weren't aware of that at all, until of course you go down deep enough and you come to the end of the iceberg. The iceberg sort of spreads out like this as you go further down its sides, until finally you come to the bottom of the iceberg and there's nothing but water underneath, there's no more ice, something quite different underneath. When you attend to the emotion as body sensation, the first things you get are not very interesting or significant, you think, just, oh, well, maybe a little tightness here. I'll be working with somebody, for example, that's like hysterically crying, and I ask them what they're feeling in their body and they say, well, I feel a little something in my throat and maybe something in my eyes. Well, I can see their body, okay, the whole body is flushed, it's red, their body is shaking, all sorts of movements are happening in the chest. That's all feeling, okay, but they're able only to contact the tip of the iceberg. As your skill in meditation grows, what it basically means is that you ride, the only way to get down to what's really there is you have to start with the tip of the iceberg. You start paying attention to the tip and then your awareness goes down below the water level or you might say another way of putting it is that you dry up the water, whatever metaphor you want to use, and now you've exposed more and you say, oh, it's much broader than what I thought. In other words, the deeper you penetrate into feeling as body sensation, the broader you experience that feeling. When you get near the bottom, the feeling is over the whole body. There's no such thing as, just like when you flip a pebble into a pond of water, you may have a big plop where the pebble lands, but the energy in that plop assuredly spreads as subtle ripples to every single part of that pond. So we could say that in an elastic medium like water, there is no such thing as a local event. There's no such thing as a local emotion, a local sensation in the body. Simply it sends waves, and that is whether it's pleasant or unpleasant. The ability to contact that and the ability not to interfere with that is exactly equivalent to the ability to experience any kind of pain, physical, psychological, or any intensity of pain without suffering, without it turning into a problem, and it's the ability to experience any kind of pleasure, however minute, with really lasting satisfaction, deep fulfillment. I'll repeat that. That was a mouthful. Okay, that was a mindful. You start with the sensation that is the tip of the iceberg, which may not seem all that significant, a little tightness in the throat, a little shaking in the arms, something like that. And as you go down the sides of the iceberg, you penetrate with your awareness. Your awareness soaks down into that tip of the iceberg, and you start to go down deeper and deeper, and you find that the feeling was actually felt, if only subtly, over the whole body. The ability to detect the global impact of feeling and to not interfere with it is the ability to experience any kind of pleasure or pain of any source, of any flavor, any intensity, be it physical or emotional pain, without suffering, without it blocking the perfection of the moment. And the ability to detect it over the whole body and not interfere with it is the ability to experience any pleasure, however tiny, with really deep and lasting satisfaction. In relationship, I personally find that the body sensation is a very productive object of meditation. Of course, you could also observe the thinking process and what have you. If you make this constant association in your own awareness that your partner, whatever else they are to you, is in addition to that the thing within which you will be purifying your consciousness, so that that person symbolically, archetypically, represents to you the place of spiritual growth. Point number one. And point number two, if you constantly have your meditation tool, your technique, ready during the day, because you can never tell when either something very pleasant or very unpleasant is going to be evoked in the relationship. And unless there is a kind of momentum, you might say almost that you're waiting in an ambush. It's not exactly like that. Waiting in ambush is usually very tense, and it's a violent metaphor. But I don't know quite else. Actually it's a sort of like a laid back waiting. It's a kind of ambush. In other words, you've got these weapons called mindfulness and equanimity. And you never know during the day when there's going to be an attack of unconsciousness and grasping. So you've got these weapons ready in hand all day, from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed, in the relationship. Because at any given moment, the relationship may bring extremes of pleasure or pain. And if the meditation tools are there, then the energy in those extremes of pleasure and pain will accrue to the process of growth and purification. If the meditation tool is not in hand, if the weapon is not there, then the extremes of pleasure and pain that come about in the relationship have a high probability of not making a permanent change within you. My purpose in talking to you today is to reinforce within you a desire to make your relationship a spiritual vehicle. Now it can also be many other things besides being a spiritual vehicle. And we don't want to take a spiritually materialistic point of view. It's sort of like I'm entering this relationship to purify myself. It's a spiritually selfish point of view. But if we're mature, then we will try to make in our minds an association in the symbolic level of our being that relationship is, amongst other things, my monastery. And you'll make a moment by moment attempt whenever you're in relationship with your companion, your significant other. There'll be that attempt to have your meditation tools present. If a person does this, then there is the optimal probability that the relationship will be successful. If a person does not do this, given the culture that we live in, there is a very high probability that the relationship will fail. I often like to rhetorically ask, how is it that in this culture people go from passionate love to acrimonious divorce in just five short years? What is the mechanism of that? Why does that happen? I'd like to suggest to you that the reason that that happens is you're passionately in love, but she likes Chinese and you like Italian tonight. She feels like Chinese and you feel like Italian. And you really like Italian. You're jaded on Chinese. Well, that gives slightly unpleasant sensations. Slightly, it's no big thing. But one has to acknowledge. There's a little bit of subtle discomfort in that fact. You're passionately in love. But you would sort of prefer Italian to Chinese. My favorite phrase, subtle is significant. That teeny little subtle discomfort associated with that little disagreement, unless you bring a gargantuan degree of mindfulness and equanimity to that little discomfort, you will not be able to completely metabolize it. People totally, totally underestimate how important it is to metabolize the teeny little discomforts that come up through little disagreements during the day. It takes a gargantuan, that is to say a gigantic effort for just a second, just a tiny second, to be completely in contact with that and to have complete equanimity with it. It takes just a second and you totally metabolize it. That's to say digest it. It breaks up into pure energy. And what? It leaves no karmic buildup. You know, like in the commercials, they talk about waxy buildup. Okay, that's a great phrase. Some PR person felt a waxy buildup. This waxy buildup happens in the storehouse consciousness. That's where the karma is stored. The unconscious in Buddhism is called the storehouse consciousness. So on the floor of consciousness, right at the very base, way, way down where no one sees it, where you don't see, it's so far down, it takes years and years of meditation to scour down to reach there. But right on the floor, right between consciousness and the ground, call it God, call it Buddha, call it whatever you want. The floor of your house rests on the ground. And what happens is that you get this sort of little layer of waxy buildup there. Because that little sensation wasn't metabolized. Because you didn't realize your tools weren't in place and probably you didn't realize how much you have to bring to bear even to deal with this tiny little thing. In other words, if you knew that you were going to participate in a very challenging thing like you were going to be a sun dancer, you were going to have to go four days without food or water in this Indian ceremony, okay, well you know that you would enter a state of where you would bring the totality of your spiritual strength because you probably couldn't survive the ceremony without that. But what people don't realize is that you have to bring the same massive amount of spiritual commitment for just an instant, a tiny instant, in order to metabolize a discomfort that comes up due to a small disagreement in your relationship. Like when you do it for a sun dance, you have to keep that degree of spiritual strength for four whole days. In relationship, you're only called to bring about your deepest state for a tiny second in order to metabolize a little disagreement or a little disappointment. But it takes the same amount. It's just a shorter time. Does that make sense, what I'm saying? That's why relationships don't work. Because first of all, people don't know what it is to bring, they don't know what the spiritual tools are, number one. And they don't realize how massively they have to apply the spiritual tools to small things, but for a short time, a very short time. You could even, one or two seconds is all it takes to metabolize something like that. But if you don't, you get waxy buildup. Then the next time something comes up, it goes on top of the former layer of waxy, karmic buildup. And then pretty soon, that stuff's reinforcing itself. And you start to hate your partner. Every little thing about them bothers you. Their physical appearance, their habits, right? Basically everything is a source. Does this sound familiar? Why has that happened? Because of what I just described. Can it be prevented? Absolutely. If a person decides to make the relationship a spiritual vehicle, then there's a high probability the relationship will be successful. If they don't, there's a high probability it won't. So these are a few points that I think are useful in remembering in terms of that aspect of life called relationship with a significant other. Ultimately, one comes to realize why it is that we want these relationships. And actually, we want the relationships for a variety of reasons. There's a hierarchy of forces that bring us into relationship. There are surface psychological forces that relate to individual personality. We like pleasant sensations for one thing, and the relationships cause pleasant sensations. We have certain psychological needs, et cetera, et cetera. We have certain conditioning. So there's a layer of what we might call surface psychological reasons that we want relationship. Most people study relationship just at that level. And that's a significant level. It's important. But ultimately, one has to realize at the deeper level why we want relationship. At the deepest level, relationship with a significant other, number one, relationship with any other human being, number two, and relationship with any object, including garbage cans and sirens, at the deepest level, these three are all really the same. The Zen master that I study with loves this word relationship, kankei in Japanese, which is literal translation in English would be relationship. But when he uses the word, he uses it to refer to not just something that happens between significant others, but something that happens between oneself and any object whatsoever, even an imagined object we make a relationship with in his sense of the word. And I think a lot of people don't really quite understand what he means by that. Right now, everyone here has a sense of self, don't you? I hope so. Do you? It's not a trick question. Do you have a sense of self? Yeah. You're smiling right now. OK. Didn't you have a wave of self-consciousness come over as you smiled? Buddhism is like science. When you're in a science class, you have to listen very carefully because the words are very carefully chosen. Something you learn when you get involved in science. Listen very carefully because they mean exactly what they say. According to Buddhism, there is no thing inside us called a self. Now this is immensely confusing and off-putting to people. Unless they listen very carefully to the statement, there is no thing inside us called a self. But assuredly, there is an experience of self-awareness, an experience of individual personality. And how does that experience come about? That experience of individual personality or self, the sense of someone being behind those eyes and between those ears, right? Don't you sense that there's someone there? OK. How does that come about? If you look very carefully, you see that there's certain ideas and certain body sensations that arise. That smile was a self-referential body sensation, a body sensation that was part of the sense of I am. Embarrassed feelings are self-referential body sensations. They're body sensations that produce upon occasion the sense I am. And there's certain images. Don't you have a mind's eye picture of yourself right now? What you look like, how your body's positioned in space, what your face looks like? Somebody's smiling, OK? There's an image of me smiling. When I said that remark, you know, I made the remark, don't you sense that isn't there a sense of someone, isn't there a sense of someone between those ears and behind those eyes? A lot of people smiled, OK? You had an upwelling of self-consciousness at that time. And then if you look carefully, you would see it subsided. In other words, certain ideas, certain mental images, and certain body sensations arose that gave the sense of self. Now here's the subtle point. When those ideas and those body sensations are experienced with complete awareness, not just the tip of the iceberg of those body sensations and those ideas, most people's sense of self is just the tip of the iceberg. When you fathom deeply down, you don't find anything different. It's just the same stuff, but just broader, wider, that's all. Unconscious just like the conscious mind, nothing different, just broader and subtler and wider. That's what happens as you get deeper down. Well when awareness penetrates not just the tip of the iceberg, those surface ideas and body sensations that are giving you the sense I am, but when the awareness and the equanimity, the noninterference, seep down all the way down to the base of those ideas and body sensations, then a rather extraordinary thing happens. The sense of I am still arises. The individual personality arises. In fact, it arises in a very uninhibited way. But the sense that there's a thing back there called the self goes away. And what you're left with is uninhibited self-referential ideas and body sensations. So you can call that an elastic self, a clear self, as opposed to self as something that's rigid and opaque. The sense of self still arises, but it arises like in a rubbery, elastic, bouncy, and transparent way. So we call that no self. In any event, just to go over the point again because it's very easy to be confused, when you're aware of the sense of self with total skill, no gaps in awareness and no interference with the upwelling of the sense of self, then what happens is that that sense of self ceases to feel like a thing and starts to feel like a movement, an activity, a process. In other words, a spirit, which is transparent and elastic and therefore insubstantial. That's why we call it no self. When we enter into a relationship with something in the way that the Zen masters use the word relationship, what that means is that the elastic vibratory flow pattern that gives us the sense of self and the flow pattern that gives us the sense of the thing, whatever that thing may be, whether it's our lover, a stranger, or a garbage can. Say it's a garbage can. How do you form a relationship with a garbage can? A Zen master might ask you a question like that. And expect a demonstration of an answer. How do you form a relationship with a... Actually they usually start out, how do you form a relationship with a tree? Garbage can's a little more advanced concept. How do you form a relationship with a tree? Well what is looking at a tree mean? Looking at a tree means that a pattern of radiant electromagnetic energy caresses a sensitized part of the skin called the back of the eye. That's what looking at a tree actually is from a physicist's point of view and that's what looking at a tree is from a meditator's point of view. So when you look at the bell, it's actually touching, there's a touch of radiant energy. And that touch is like a caressing. It's like any other touch. When somebody touches you, that's why we make love that way. The touch movement, we want to have the touch move all over that person. And the way that the touch moves all over that person is a kind of wave form. Then we can merge with that person. The exact same thing happens when you look at something. But the touch sense is vision, it's not erotic body sensation. But the relationship is exactly the same. And when we make love, and the reason that we touch in that smooth and continuous and fluid and special way is, okay, that caressing is because we want to experience that other as a wave form of sensation. Well when you look at something, if you don't congeal instant by instant the pattern of electromagnetic energy, in other words, if there's no tension in the retina of your eye and in your optic nerve, then you will find that that energy is making love. You may think that I'm just playing with words or trying to use shocking vocabulary, but you'll find that the light is caressing, is making love to your retina. You'll form a relationship to the tree or the garbage can. In other words, the wave form that gives you the sense of self and the wave form that gives you the sense of the other join and become a single wave form. Two ice cubes can never join, but take the same substance and melt it. Two streams of water automatically join. Same substance. Self over here as a thing and her or him over there as a thing can never really join. But self over here as a wave form and her or him over there as a wave form automatically join. That's what we really want. We want to make relationship in the Zen sense of the word relationship. And nature has provided us with a certain erotic mechanism, but also has sort of cursed us. That erotic mechanism allows us to merge with another, but it produces all these pleasant sensations which we then grasp onto and clouds our awareness and we don't really understand the nature of merging. Even though we may have fantastically intense sex, we don't ever get down to what's really going on. We fail to be able to form relationship in general with everything, the whole world. So the idea is that we come to realize ultimately that the reason we want relationship with the significant other, in addition to all the psychological, personal reasons which are valid, is that there's a deep spiritual need to experience oneness. That we become a wave and it become a wave and those two waves join in something that has no words in the human language to describe it. And we come to realize that we can have that in a relationship with a significant other. We can have that in a relationship to any human being, a stranger. And we can have that in relationship to any object at all. Once we realize that, then we've understood at a very deep level this phenomenon of relationship. And we're able to be fulfilled in a way independent of conditions.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.0, "text": " Sometimes when I perform marriage ceremonies, I like to say
