{"text": " If that's not enough, if you still need another reason to do this path, well, I said that we do this path because of our situation. Our situation is to have mental experience and body experience and to have behavior. That's the self. But there's more to our situation than our self. There's all the people around us, all the sentient beings around us, and indeed the plants and the earth, our environment. Our situation is not just self. Our situation is other. Zen Master Dogen said, to practice the way is shinjin datsuraku. Hard to translate this in English. But it's something like shed mind and body. And then when people ask for more detail, what do you mean by shed mind and body? He said, it is to cause the shedding of your own mind and body and the minds and bodies of all other beings. Now think about it. Has he pretty much covered all the possibilities? Where do we get caught? We either get caught in our own minds, in our own bodies, or in somebody else's mind, or in somebody else's body. Those are the places you're going to get caught. So to release, maybe another word would be release. Release one's own mind and body and the minds and bodies of all other beings. So how do you release the minds and bodies of all other beings? Well, first by modeling what the release of the mind and body is yourself, in your own life. Why would you want to ease the mind-body burden of all other beings? Because, as you'll remember, one of the effects of this path is wisdom, prajna. And wisdom is a many-faceted jewel. There's a lot of sides to it. Another metaphor is, it's like an elephant. Wisdom is like an elephant. You've heard the story of the blind man and the elephant? You know that story? A bunch of blind men are presented with a thing called an elephant. And one of them feels the side of the elephant and says, Oh, I understand what an elephant is. Elephant is like a wall. Another one feels the leg, touches the leg, and says, I understand what an elephant is. Elephant is like a pillar. Another one grabs the tail and says, I understand what an elephant is. Elephant is like a rope. Well, these are all aspects of elephant. The wisdom function is like that. There's all of these different sides to it. One side deals with the knowledge of how to experience pleasure with real fulfillment and how to experience pain without suffering. That's a wisdom. Another side deals with impermanence. So, nature of suffering, nature of fulfillment, nature of impermanence. But you remember that I said that there's a certain side of wisdom that deals with what is a healthy experience of oneness and what is a healthy experience of individuality and how do those relate and so forth. You come to understand how the separation between inside and outside comes about. And by understanding that, you understand how a sense of oneness of inside and outside can come about. There's nothing mystical schmistical about it, really. My teacher Sasaki Roshi, if you studied with him, the first koan he would give you would probably be something like, when you see the flower, how do you experience one true love? Something like that. Well, if there is just seeing, then... and for three seconds, five seconds, ten seconds, twenty seconds, thirty seconds, there's just seeing and no feel-image-talk. Then, after five, ten, twenty, thirty seconds like that, you become flower. You become the doing called flower. And then you look back and say, wow, I actually was the flower for real. And then you think, well then, I must not be fundamentally separate. And if you have hundreds of those experiences each day, day after day after day, there arises within you an industrial strength sense of oneness with all of creation. Industrial strength. That's what we're aiming at. It can't be Kleenex strong. It's got to be stainless steel strong. Industrial strength. Otherwise, as soon as the doo-doo hits the fan, it just vanishes. The sort of airy-fairy oneness that is the New Age nostrum, it's not going to do much good. You want to get to the industrial strength oneness. And then from that, naturally, comes a sense of care for your larger identity. Even if you didn't want to be a nice person, you wouldn't have any choice. You'd be forced. I've met masters that I don't think they're really nice people. And I don't think they even want to be nice people. But they have to be nice people. They can't help it. They don't have any choice. The wisdom function has become so clear within them that, like it or not, they're loving and compassionate. I love the Judaic conception of this as Tikkun Ha'olam, the mending of the world, that will bring about, ultimately, the Messianic age. I think there may be something to that view of history, but I don't think that it's going to turn out to be the mythological Messiah that the Abrahamic religions believe in. I think it's going to have a very different avatar, a very different form on this planet that they never conceived of. But it's going to turn out to be something along the lines of a golden age. So that's another reason to do this path. Others. There's you, there's the I, and there's the thou. So those are two good reasons to do the path. If you want a little more detail, the I has behaviors that we would like to improve, and the I has experiences. The experiences are mind experiences and body experiences. The body experiences are physical and emotional, and each one of those can be pleasant or unpleasant. We would like to have the pleasant ones bring us really lasting fulfillment, not just temporary intensity, variety, and duration. We would like the unpleasant sensations to not cause us suffering, but at the same time to motivate and direct our behaviors. We would like to have answers, but ultimately the really deep answers. And we would like to not have confusion be an issue, which is not quite the same as not have confusion. So is that enough reasons to do this path? Does that pretty much cover it? I think so. I was once in a sweat lodge in Malibu that was run by a woman who some of you know, Lisa Wapipa. She's Lakota, the Sioux Nation, and she tends to pour a little bit of a hot, hot sweat. So it was getting hot and it was getting tough, and you could hear people moaning. You know that point when it's like people are right at the boundary of what is bearable. And she had this incredible thing that she said that just blew me over. She said, I know this path is hard, I know this path is hard, but there's one thing harder than doing this path, and that's not doing this path. And it is so true. It is so true. So I know this path is hard, okay. I know we sit here and the mind's wandering and sleepy and achy, and it's like, why am I doing this? Why are we doing this? Well, now you have an idea of the awesome extent of the this, what this, this path, how big it is, how old it is, how huge it is. And you should have some idea of the why. And the fact is that whatever negative tapes you might have or beliefs you might have about yourself, we all have those judgments that come up. The fact is, undeniable, you're here, you're actually doing this path. I'd like to talk about why we're doing this. Now, as I say, relative to Mount Baldy, our situation here is benign, to put it mildly. Yet, I'm sure that from time to time, many of us think, why am I doing this? Why am I doing this when I could be doing so many other things? So, in order to address the question of why are we doing this, first let's talk about what the this is, and then let's talk about the why. If you're following along, as I suspect most of you are, using the procedures that I introduce in the group process and have taught you at other retreats, then the this that you're doing is one Westerner's version of the vipassana practice. That's the this that you're doing, most specifically speaking. So, I'd like to give you an idea of how I came upon this particular version of doing the vipassana practice. Just so you'll know, historically, the influences on me have been, first and foremost, the Buddha himself. I believe that the Buddha made several fundamental, unique discoveries. He was the first person, the only person, to discover these things, as far as we know, at least historically. There probably were other people, but we don't have a historical record of them. These things were probably discovered by others, but historically speaking, the Buddha was the first. What are the things he discovered? Well, in my book, first and foremost, he discovered that concentration power, which was a well-known practice, the development of high states of concentration was a well-known practice in India, had existed for a long time prior to the Buddha. But what the Buddha discovered was that concentration power could be used to tease apart one's experience of self. As the result of that, there would be a sense of freedom, a liberation, and an insight into how the sense of self arises. As far as I know, the Buddha was the first to apply what is essentially the method of science. The nuts and bolts of science is you present a scientist with an inscrutable, complex system in nature, and ask, how does it work? What the scientists will do is they'll say, well, let's see, what are the natural components? What are the parts? Once we figure out what the parts are, we can explore how they interact, and as a result of that, we can create a theory, a model, for this system. The Buddha discovered the essence of the scientific, or let's put it, maybe not the essence of the scientific method, but he discovered something very akin to science, and applied it to the phenomenon called I Am. This might be described as a method of deconstruction in the positive sense of the word deconstruction, in the sense that mathematicians and scientists are always trying to deconstruct natural systems in order to understand them. That basic model is certainly a major influence on me. Another influence on me comes from the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition of Vipassana. They're the ones that came up with the idea of making mental labels in order to assure mindfulness. However, the label categories that I give you are not the ones they typically use. The notion of labeling, the procedure I got from the Mahasi lineage. But I have found, just experimenting in the field, that more precise labels and more carefully thought out hierarchies of label structures seem to produce clearer results. There you get another influence on me, which is the Western mathematical way of thinking, where you try to be very precise about definitions and how categories are presented. That's been another influence. Maybe I'm a mixture of influence from Mahasi Sayadaw and influence from Euclid and Aristotle. That's what has come together to give you the kinds of categories that I have you label. From the Uba-Kin lineage, which is another lineage of Burmese Vipassana, I learned about the importance of body sensations and ways of working with body sensation. And its whole role in this process. And then from Sasaki Roshi, I got a model for anicca, or impermanence. In early Buddhism, anicca, or impermanence, was formulated in terms of dukkha, or suffering. Impermanence meant things pass, everything's going to pass, all the things we love and care about are going to pass. But we invest our happiness in their permanence. So we set ourselves up for suffering, literally, by saying, my happiness depends on X, Y, and Z lasting, when X, Y, and Z cannot last. My body, your body, cannot last. The body of everyone you love cannot last. Even a country that you love cannot last. Things change. An institution that you love cannot last. It might last a long time, but not forever. Anicca and dukkha were very linked in early Buddhism. But over the course of Buddhist history, the notion of impermanence has been broadened and evolved. For example, in the Upa-Kin lineage of Vipassana, impermanence isn't just a negative. Impermanence is also the sort of blissful, vibratory flow energy that you get as you pay attention to body sensation, and then eventually you get in all the sense domains, including external vision. So Upa-Kin looked upon impermanence as a kind of helper, a kind of energy that gets activated. He saw it primarily in the body, and indeed it's easiest to activate it in the body gate. That then sort of carries you and purifies you, in some ways a notion similar to spirit, Holy Spirit, the paraclete in the Western religions. But Sasaki Roshi has the most startling original and broad formulation of impermanence, and I'll be talking about that throughout this retreat. So that's what you're getting. You're getting my sort of mixture of influences from various Buddhist traditions, and also from the Western tradition. In the most narrow context, when we say, why are we doing this, if the this is my techniques, then that's what the this refers to. However, if we broaden our perspective a little bit, yes, you may be doing procedures that I taught you, but more broadly, you're doing Vipassana. So what is the essence of Vipassana? What can we say that's true of any lineage of Vipassana? Whether it's the Udbhakyan lineage, the Mahasi lineage, the Taung Pulu lineage, the Sun Lung lineage, the Ajahn Chah lineage, or any one of the number of hybrid Western lineages like what I'm giving you. What's the underlying commonality? Well, I would say that the underlying commonality is, in all cases, one is taught to cultivate clarity and equanimity with regard to sensory experience. The specific procedures that may be used, the specific sensory experiences that may be chosen as focus, will vary from lineage to lineage. But all forms of Vipassana have this in common. But they go about it in very different ways. A little more broadly, in doing Vipassana, you are doing Buddhism. But the Buddhist tradition is bigger than Vipassana. It is believed by most objective scholars, and I'm sure most of you are aware of this, that what the Buddha taught originally was something like Vipassana, but was not identical to any of the contemporary lineages. But it was something along those lines, something along the lines of Vipassana. Later on, other facets of enlightenment were emphasized by later teachers. Things that the Buddha didn't talk about, that are facets of the jewel of enlightenment, were emphasized by other teachers. That led to the development of Mahayana Buddhism that came into China and was radically transformed over a number of centuries through interaction with Chinese culture, turned into Chan, which we know better by its Japanese name, Zen. So that represents another practice lineage. And then in India, Mahayana developed into Vajrayana. Vajra means diamond, among other things in Sanskrit. The Vajrayana tradition went into Tibet, where it dominated, and that represents a whole other way of achieving enlightenment. However, there is a commonality within all of Buddhism, whether it's the Vipassana way of working, the Zen way of working, or the Vajrayana way of working. There are certain common characteristics. Each of these ways of working brings about insight into the nature of self. But the method, the perception of self, but the method used is quite different. In Vipassana, you already know what the method is. We construct it down to its components, observe them for long periods of time, not short periods, long periods of time, bring clarity and equanimity, clarity and equanimity, and insight into the nature of self arises. In Rinzai Zen, somewhat different approaches are used. They would say, well, if you do Vipassana, the problem is that there's always going to be this observer observing the self, and you won't get free. Some Zen people might criticize. But of course, that's a possible danger in Vipassana, but it's certainly not a fundamental flaw in Vipassana. Because at some point, the momentum of clarity and equanimity becomes so great that you don't need a meditating self to maintain it. And the subtle feel-image-talk that would produce the sense of an eye observing myself, that doesn't get observed, but it gets clarified, which is a little different. And you do, in fact, become free. If the Zen criticism of Vipassana were, in fact, true, then the Buddha wasn't enlightened. And that would be a ludicrous implication for a Buddhist to claim that the Buddha wasn't enlightened. However, the Zen criticism of Vipassana has a point to it that needs to be heeded. Now, what the Zen people would say is, we have a way of getting around this problem of the observing self. When you go to a Zen teacher like Sasaki Roshi, he'd ask you, he'd do something like that and say, at the instant you heard the sound, where were you? At the instant that you look at the flower, where are you? At the instant that you turn towards the bird, where are you? When you drive the car, where are you? Now, I could give you an intellectual answer to those koans, and being a Vipassana teacher, I'm allowed to do that. In Zen, though, you would have to manifest the answer, not explain it. But I'll explain it. At the instant of hearing of the sound, before there's any feel, image, talk, reaction, there's only sound and also. So, in Zen, they will have you initially practice totally focusing on the external world of sight, sound, physical touch, until you notice that the feel, image, talk self vanishes. So, in a sense, they use the external world, the energy, the center of gravity that is represented by an external stimulus. They use that to rip away the center of gravity that is represented by feel, image, talk, self. So, you don't meditate. Your self is grabbed by the flower. And they're just asking you to notice that that happens automatically, and that you're freed from the self moment by moment. And then, of course, an instant later, there's going to be a reaction. You're going to say, ah, that's a beautiful flower, and you get a smile on your face. You remember the flower. So, image, talk, feel, the self returns. And you notice that because you saw it, you were aware of the disappearance. So, they use your relationship to the outside world in order to teach insight into no self. That was one of Sasaki Roshi's answers to a question once, what I just did. He did it with tea. We were in Puerto Rico, and we were on TV, we meaning Sasaki Roshi and a bunch of his Puerto Rican Buddhist students. And they were having discussions, and then they opened it up for questions. From the audience, and this Catholic priest asked, Roshi, what is your experience of God? So, here you are in a Catholic country, Buddhist teacher, and a priest asking you on public TV, what is your experience of God? So, what are you going to do? You want to get into a theological punch out? That's not going to go very far. So, how about demonstrating right there and then, without hesitating, in front of everybody, your experience of God. So, the priest said, Roshi, what is your experience of God? I translated that into Japanese. So, we're all talking, so everybody has tea cups, right? So, he picks up the tea cup. There are actually two parts to the answer. The first part was the experience of God. The second part was making an object of the experience of God. That was the ahhhh. The first part was the drinking of the water, in a way where there was only water and no self. So, that's it. Vajrayana, well, we won't go into details, but basically, if self arises from feel-image-talk, what if you replace body-image-talk broadly, touch-feel-image-talk specifically, what if you were to replace ordinary touch-feel-image-talk with mythological touch-feel-image-talk? What's mythological touch? Mudra, hieratic gesture. What's mythological image? Well, you see a God in front of you. You see yourself as a God. You see your image of surroundings as a divine castle of some sort. What's archetypical feel? Would be pure love, compassion, and nothing else. What's archetypical talk? Mantra. So, you see the deity in front of you. Your heart fills with love. You make the same physical gestures as the deity with your body. You visualize your own body as the deity's body. So, not only is the deity in front of you, but also you are the deity looking at the deity. You replace your images of surroundings with this whole mythological sort of castle in the mandala, and you replace your internal talk with mantra, and guess what? The human self disappears, and a mythological identity arises for real. For real. But since it's an arbitrary creation, you get insight into the arbitrary nature of self-identification. So, you might say in early Buddhism, you deconstruct the natural system into its components. Later on, many centuries later, Buddhists learned to reverse engineer the ego. Do you know what that means? Reverse engineering? It's like once you know what the components are, you can sort of recreate the thing backwards. So, you reverse engineer it. You create an arbitrary self that's obviously a myth. But in the act of doing it, you come to the same insight, the arbitrary nature of self-identification. So, although the three different ways of working are very, very different, in Vipassana, Zen, and Vajrayana, I see the commonality as they lead to the same insight with regard to the nature of self. However, in doing Buddhism, more broadly, you're doing something much bigger than Buddhism. Because Buddhism is just one manifestation on this planet of mystical consciousness or enlightenment or meditative awareness, contemplative practice. There are ways of working outside of Buddhism that bring equally deep results, but work from very different models. For example, the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, each has their meditative traditions. Although the theologies differ greatly amongst themselves and also with regard to Buddhism, it's very evident that people working within these traditions come to the same experiences as people working within the Buddhist tradition. And that's the Abrahamic religions. Then there's Taoism, which talks about yin-yang, two principles interacting to create all things. Sound familiar? Then there's shamanism, the really old religion of this planet. Now, there's a certain amount of working in the realms of power involved in shamanism. Basically, you could look upon the path as going from surface to source, surface of consciousness to source of consciousness, and you might traverse some intermediate realms where you get unusual powers. Shamanism sometimes involves those things, but it also involves a component, very much a component, of going from surface to source. So, all over the world, in every time, in every culture, inside and outside of organized religion, there have been those individuals that have taken spirituality to another dimension, you might say, have made a quantum leap in their spirituality. Instead of a spirituality based on certain kinds of feelings and certain kinds of internal talk and certain kinds of visions, they came to a spirituality that involved a radical shift in their relationship to all body sensation, all mental image, all internal talk. Everything becomes spiritualized for an enlightened person, even hearing and seeing. Every time you turn your head, you cannot avoid the beatific vision. Every stray thought, you cannot avoid it being a profound theology and a prayer that connects you to the source. In the Christian tradition, that's called the practice of the presence of God, but in Buddhism, it's called enlightenment. In Taoism, it's called becoming a zhenren. I love that phrase in Chinese. It means a real person. In Taoism, an enlightened person is just called zhenren. Very simple. It's a real person. Zen Master Rinzai talked about wu wei zhenren, the true person that has no fixed position. We have now answered in a fair amount of detail the this part and the question, why are we doing this? The this that we are doing is something human beings have been doing in one form or another for millennia, tens of millennia. Who knows? Maybe we did it when we were advanced primates. Who knows how far back the path of enlightenment goes? But certainly, its roots are deep, deep in prehistory. In the broadest context, when we come here to do what we are doing, we are linked to tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, who knows? If we count other planets, maybe trillions upon trillions of beings. Who knows how many? Who have come down this path? That's the this that we are doing. It's much bigger than the techniques I give you. It's much bigger than Buddhism, by far. That was one of the most extraordinary discoveries that I made. It was a Catholic priest that clued me into this, Father William Johnston, who I met in Japan. I thought all this stuff was just in Buddhism. No, it's all over the world. It's the perennial philosophy, the perennial experience. When we sit here, we are linked to all the people that have done this, perhaps beyond people, all the beings that have done this. In that sense, it is undeniable that it is well that you have come. You are welcome to join that extraordinary community. Yesterday, I started to talk about the topic of why are we doing this. I never got past the this part. The this is pretty big, actually. What we are doing is part of something that is huge and extraordinary and has been going on from time immemorial on this planet. We are just doing one specific form of it. I find that very inspiring to know that behind me, I have all of these generations of all of these different kinds of people from different cultures and different times who basically came down this same path. We might describe it. It's interesting. We don't really have a universal word for it. Scholars of religion call it mystical experience, but that's not the best term because in colloquial usage, mystical implies sort of mystical-schmistical, new-agey, power realm kinds of things. Some people call it cosmic consciousness. Some people call it enlightenment, what have you. This is the this that we are engaged in here. I find it useful when I'm asking myself why am I doing this to keep a few words in mind that remind me why I do this. Basically, why I do this is because of my situation. What is my situation? My situation is that I have myself and I have my surrounding world. If we just look at myself for a moment, there's sort of two parts to that. There's my subjective experience and there's my objective behavior. If we look at my subjective experience, and it's also true for any other person, basically our subjective experience consists of mental experience and it consists of body experience. My body is going to be subject to physical-type sensations and it's going to be subject to emotional-type sensations. Furthermore, some of those physical-type sensations will be pleasant, some of them will be unpleasant, and some of those emotional-type sensations will be pleasant, and some of them will be unpleasant. Now, my body would like to avoid discomfort, physical or emotional, and it would like to find pleasure, physical or emotional. That's sort of how it conceives of its job. My job is to get comfortable. But can I always get comfortable? Or should I always even be comfortable? Well, the answer is no. So, really, at a deeper level, what my body wants is not to avoid discomfort and find pleasure, but to avoid suffering and find fulfillment, which is a much deeper notion. In other words, my body, at the deepest level, would like to know a kind of pleasure that, in a sense, is beyond pleasure and pain. Now, I know that that seems like playing with words, or just sort of juggling words in a way that might seem cavalier, but I don't know how else to put it. It turns out that we can have our cake and eat it, too. The practice of clarity and equanimity will allow us to experience physical and emotional pleasure with vastly deepened fulfillment, and it will allow us to experience physical and emotional discomfort with vastly diminished suffering. So we get to have our cake and eat it, too, because we get to be human, to have the richness of a body sensation that is part of being a human being. But on the other hand, we get to be transcendent. And it turns out that this comes about through something rather simple, just learning how to be very, very precise and very, very gentle and matter-of-fact with our body experiences. That's why it's sometimes referred to as the miracle of mindfulness. I find it rather miraculous that, through something as seemingly innocuous as training oneself to be precise and training oneself to not interfere with the flow of sensation, through something as innocuous as that, this extraordinary, seemingly innocuous banal, this extraordinary transformation takes place, a literal re-engineering of our relationship to body sensation. So one of the reasons that I do this, this path, is because I have a body. And my body is going to be subject to these sensations, needs to be subject to these sensations, and I would like to have my cake and eat it, too. I would like to experience the richness of being a human being, but also I would like my happiness not to be dependent on conditions. And it turns out that through learning how to have a complete experience of the body, complete experience is what comes about when you bring enough clarity and enough equanimity to the body, then you have a complete experience of the body in that moment. It turns out that by having a complete experience of the body, we can have the best of both worlds. So, in point of fact, if you only had a body and didn't have a mind, you would still have a reason to do this path. The body would be a reason. In fact, if you only had emotional-type sensations and didn't even have physical ones, you would have a reason to do this path. Initially, when we sit, we often get a lot of physical-type discomforts. And I remember I used to think, why am I wasting my time sitting here, and my legs are aching? It's like, you know, this is stupid. But in retrospect, this is when I began my practice in Japan. It was samurai boot camp training, you know, where you lock your body in full lotus and just sit there for an hour. My whole body would shake, and I'd be on the verge of tears. Every sit was that way. It's like, this is looney tunes. Why am I exposing myself to just nothing but discomfort? This is when I began meditating. I had this idea, this is stupid. What I should do is I should go back to the United States, and I'm sure I can get some doctor to do some sort of operation to stretch my tendons so that I can sit in the full lotus for hours on end without all of this travail. That's the logical way to do it. The way these people in Japan are doing it, this is stupid and a waste of time, and all this physical discomfort is pointless. I actually believed that, right? But I was stuck there. In retrospect, of course, I realize now that all of that physical discomfort was a very, very important learning process. For one thing, that struggle leads to a sense of compassion. Later on, when you start to get some complete experiences of the body, for moments, perhaps just for a few seconds at a time, actually step beyond the human condition and become free from suffering, you could just sit there forever. You don't forget how much you went through initially. So when you see other people that are in physical discomfort, that initial struggle that you go through, it's planted a seed within you, a seed of compassion for others, because you really know the reality of pain, because you had to face it hour after hour, day after day, month after month. You don't forget, even later on when you start to, as I say, see beyond these things, you don't forget what that is like. You want to help other people as your spiritual career evolves. So for one thing, it plants the seeds of compassion, and that's a very important reason to have to go through that. The other thing, though, is in general, challenging though it is, the physical type sensations, what I refer to generically as touches, they're the easy ones to deal with, relatively speaking. You know, the aches and pains, hot and cold, exhaustion, flavors, and so forth in the body. Challenging though they are, they tend to, they're gross, they're not terribly mixed up with talk and image, they're not too tangled, they're somewhat tangled, but not totally tangled, and they're very obvious, and when you bring equanimity to them, it's very easy to see how they dissolve, and so forth. Learning with the physical discomfort is relatively easy, relative to what? Relative to learning how to have equanimity with the emotional type sensations, both pleasant and unpleasant. Those are the tricky ones. They're subtler, they're very tangled with talk and image, they're linked to really deep circuits of reward and punishment inside the limbic brain, it's really hard to have equanimity with anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, even impatience, agitation, it's hard to have equanimity with those sensations. It's hard to have equanimity with interest, joy, love, gratitude, laughter. Try having equanimity with laughter someday, as a sensation. You know that thing about facing somebody and not, like the first one that smiles, or laughs, loses, right? And you just look at each other and don't say anything? That'll show you how hard it is to have equanimity with the laughter flavor. The laughter flavor starts to fill the body, and if you have perfect equanimity with it, you won't smile, you won't have to smile. I won't say you won't smile, you won't have to smile, you won't have to laugh. So even something as seemingly trivial as the smile-laughter type of feel, these are very challenging. So one of the reasons I think that we have to put up with all the physical discomforts is that we'll learn our lessons with those gross physical sensations, and then somewhere down the line we'll actually be able to apply the same principles of clarity and equanimity to pleasant and unpleasant emotional-type sensations. So basically, you might say that the world consists of three kinds of people, from a certain perspective. I mean, there's lots of ways you can chop up the pie. But first there is the great majority of human beings who have actually never had the experience of staying with a physical discomfort until it completed itself. Just think about it. The great majority of human beings have never had that experience. They must live under the sword of Damocles. You know, the sword of Damocles. There's a famous story about this person who was praising this king, Damocles, back in ancient Greece. He said, Oh, your majesty, you're so wonderful, and blah, blah, blah, and it must be so wonderful to be the king. And Damocles said, Well, I'll show you what it's like to be a king. He invited him to this. He said, Okay, come in this room, and I want you to... Here's my throne, okay? And I'm going to let you sit in it. And the guy said, looked at... and he said, Are you crazy? You've set it up with a sword hanging right above, held by just this thin little thread. It could fall any time. If I sit on that throne, I could be killed at any instant. And King Damocles said, That's what it's like to be king. Yes, you have all this power and whatever, but at any instant, you could be invaded, your enemies could... there could be a rebellion, there could be all sorts of things. So you must live with constant terror. Then that gave us the expression in English to live under the sword of Damocles, meaning under a constant threat. Well, the great majority of human beings live under a sword of Damocles without even realizing it. They don't know that it is possible to break through physical pain. They've never had that experience. So if you cannot anesthetize it or relieve its source, then there's no knowledge of an alternative. One of the things that we learn on this path as we sit here is that it is possible to break through physical discomfort, break through in the sense of have a complete experience. After you've had that experience, that sort of puts you in a different class of human beings. You don't live under that same sword of Damocles. You know that if the condition couldn't be relieved or couldn't be anesthetized, you might have to work like hell, but there would be an alternative, something you could do. You could escape into it. You know that because you have done it. It's an actual experience. It's not a theory. As I say, that sort of puts you into another class of human beings. But you still don't believe that you could do that with real fear. The average human being doesn't believe you could do it with real physical pain. Come on, it's real. It's caused by something physical. What do you mean you could break through it? But after you've broken through physical pain, you still don't believe that real fear due to real circumstances, real anger because of something legitimate, righteous anger, real sadness due to real bereavement, you don't believe that those sensations could ever break up into flow or better still return to zero before your very eyes. But at some point, you apply the same things you've learned with the physical to the emotional. You tease out the flavors, you penetrate the flavor, and you actually have the experience of full-blown, real intense emotions in the body dissolving. And that puts you into a third class of human beings. The ones that have had experiential knowledge of complete feeling. So then you don't live under the sort of Damocles called emotions where you have to worry about the emotions that are going to drive and distort behavior. You still have to deal with them. Just because you've seen it once doesn't mean you can necessarily do it consistently, but at least you're over the hump. You've seen that it actually is possible. Before your very eyes, it actually happened. So one of the reasons to do this path is because we have a body. And the body wants to get comfortable and avoid discomfort. But there is a kind of freedom from discomfort that is, as I say, beyond pleasure and pain. And there is a kind of comfort that is beyond pleasure and pain. And that turns out to be nothing more than the complete experience of pleasure and pain. So if you forget why to do this path, just remember the word body. Or even if you forget that word, don't worry. Next time it's a little too hot or a little too cold, physically or metaphorically, you'll remember that you have a body. So that's a pretty good reason to do this path. We have a mind. That's another reason to do this path. Because the mind has a job too. It conceives of its job as find clarity and avoid confusion. So sort of parallel to the body. The body wants to avoid pain and find pleasure. The mind wants to avoid confusion, avoid chaos, avoid don't know, and get answers. However, I would suggest that there are two kinds of answers. Or, no, that's not right. There's a spectrum of depth of answer. There's answer to specific questions like, you know, what am I going to make for breakfast? Or how am I going to get some extra cash this month? Or how am I going to find the relationship I'm looking for? Or, you know, there's the answers to this and that. Then there are some deeper kinds of clarity that relate to knowing about yourself in terms of your personality. Why do I have these patterns in my life? What do they mean? What should I do about them? How did they come about? That's a little deeper than just sort of solving this or that life question or intellectual question. That's the kind of thing that effective therapy can help you with sometimes, counseling. Then there are the really deep questions. Who am I in the deepest sense of the word? What's the spiritual source of self and world, the deepest sense of that? What's a healthy experience of individuality? What is an unhealthy experience of individuality? What is a healthy experience of oneness? What is an unhealthy experience of oneness? These are deep questions. One can speculate intellectually about these questions, but there's a limitation as to how productive that is. However, it turns out that by following this path, we can come to answers to those very deep questions. The answers are direct and experiential. Once again, this path, at least to the extent that we're doing vipassana, is amazingly just being precise and matter-of-fact about things. You wouldn't think that just being precise and matter-of-fact about our sensory experience could solve such profound questions, fundamental questions about our being. But it turns out that if you do enough of it, a little bit doesn't help. You have to do massive amounts of mindfulness, of clarity and equanimity, massive amounts, a critical mass once it gets built up. And aha experiences start to arise. That is the wisdom function arising within us. You actually get a sense of how it is that the self, second by second, arises. Of course, I could describe it in words. In fact, I could describe it in words from a lot of different perspectives, alternative models for it. But the important thing is to experience it yourself directly. So because we have a mind and the mind wants to have clarity, we do this path because the mind doesn't just want to have clarity. In the end, it wants to have clarity about the deepest of all questions. So if we do this practice, we can't guarantee it, but we give a high probability that you'll start to have some aha experiences. The mind wants to find answers, but it also wants to avoid confusion. However, actually, what it really wants is not so much to avoid confusion, but rather to avoid being caught in confusion. That's not quite the same as being confused. Actually, if you are confused and you stay confused for a long enough time with equanimity, that's another way of fostering the wisdom function. So what the mind really wants, as I say, is not to avoid confusion, but rather to avoid the experience of being trapped or fixated in confusion. In a sense, confusion, not having answers, being muddled, being stymied intellectually. In a sense, confusion is to the mind as discomfort is to the body. If you have equanimity with confusion and keep it up long enough, the mind actually starts to think in a new way. So there are several ways that you can foster the wisdom function. One way is that you can carefully observe and clarify. That's vipassana. As a result of that, new understandings arise. But there's a whole other way to foster the exact same wisdom process. You wouldn't think that the two forms of wisdom were related. You would think they'd be completely different because the method for getting there is so different. But another way to foster the prajna or the wisdom function is to consistently greet don't know with equanimity. So this method of fostering wisdom by intentionally having equanimity with confused states, as far as I know, has been discovered three times totally independently by human beings. Once in ancient Greece, where it was practiced by the sceptics, the sceptical philosophers, who called it epiche, e-p-o-c-h-e. Epiche means having equanimity with don't know in order to foster a new way of knowing. Now, that's a pretty subtle concept. I believe this word should be reintroduced into the languages of the West. You can find the word in the Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, the one that has 600,000 words in it. One of those words is epiche, e-p-o-c-h-e. But I think this is a notion that deserves to be understood as a concept. Epiche means to suspend, to hold up, suspend the need to know in order to know in a new way. That's a very subtle concept. As far as I know, the first people to discover this notion were in ancient Greece. It was rediscovered in the Middle Ages in Europe, where it was called various things, one of them being docta ignorantia, or learned ignorance. And it was considered the direct path to knowing God. You could read about it in this wonderful classic called The Cloud of Unknowing. That's a book that I kept by my side during my first training period. When I had my first training in Shingon, which is Japanese Vajrayana Buddhism, it was 100 days in isolation. I couldn't talk to anybody except my teacher, and that was only every three days and for 10 minutes. I had very few things. I had the manuals for how to do the Vajrayana rituals, and I had The Cloud of Unknowing. I read it every day, and it was really helpful. The third time it was discovered was the Linji, or Rinzai school of Zen in East Asia, where they use what are called koans, like what is the sound of one hand, and so forth. It's totally confusing. It's like, how do you answer a question like that? The more you think about it, the more confused you get. At some point, instead of trying to think of an answer, you just are okay with not having an answer, and an answer flows through you, and you pass the koan, and then they give you another one, and another one, and another one. It gets you more and more and more confused. Then 20 years later, they give you the same koan you had at the beginning. They start you again. Another reason to do this path is because we have a mind. Even if we didn't have a body, we would have a mind. The mind wants clarity, but not just any clarity. Ultimately, the mind wants clarity about the fundamental issues. Gnothi se athon, know thyself. What am I at the deepest level? We won't be satisfied until we know for sure, through direct experience, our spiritual nature. So the mind wants to know, but ultimately it wants to know the really deep questions. It seems to want to avoid confusion, but actually, ultimately, it doesn't want to avoid confusion. It wants to avoid confusion as a problem, being caught in confusion. When you have equanimity with confusion, then amazingly, confusion flows. When confusion is fluid enough, it's called wisdom. That's quite a concept to wrap your intellect around, isn't it? A good vipassana teacher, when they're done with their talk, it's like you leave and you have clarity. Ah, I see. It's like crystal clear. I know exactly what they're talking about, exactly what to do. The Buddha said that the dhamma, the dharma in other words, is sandritiko. That's in Pali, sandrishtiko. Sandrishtika in Sanskrit it would be. Sandrishtiko means crystal clear. I like that. Being something of a dilettante mathematician, I have a sense of what pellucid clarity can be. Swakatto bhagavata dhammo. If you've never heard the Pali language, this isn't exactly the language that the Buddha spoke, but it's very close. Swakatto bhagavata dhammo sandrishtiko akaliko ehipassiko opanaiko pacchattam veditappo vinuhiti. It means swakatto, well enunciated bhagavata by the fortunate one. That's a title. Dhammo is the dharma. Sandrishtiko, it's crystal clear. Akaliko, it is immediately efficacious. It is without kala, without time. You could maybe interpret it as meaning timeless also, but I think it meant you do it and you get results. Ehipassiko, it is of the nature of come see. Ehipassa, it means come see. You can see for yourself. Opanaiko, it is skillfully, it's a skillful means. Pacchattam veditappo vinuhiti. It is to be known individually by each wise person. When you hear a vipassana teacher talk, and if it's a good talk, it's like sandrishtiko. It's like crystal clear. If you hear a Zen teacher talk, you're totally confused, but you don't care. They put you into equanimity with don't know. It's like, what did they say? But something in you doesn't care that you can't figure out what they say. They grabbed your belly button. They didn't grab what was between your ears. They grabbed your belly button. So if you ever forget why to do this practice, just remember body and mind. If that's not enough reason to do this practice, let me give you some more. Body experience and mental experience, they're just experiences. What about behavior? We are a system that doesn't just experience, it acts. We say things, we do things, we intentionally think about things. Interesting thing about mind, isn't it? In some way it's a sense organ, and in another sense it's a motor organ, something we can control. You've probably noticed as you sit there, some thoughts just happen to you, the way sounds or sights happen. It's passive. Other thoughts, you're proactive, you're actually controlling it. It's a very interesting thing about the mind gate. In some ways it's a sensory gate, and so counted in Buddhism, but in other ways it's a motor function, something you control. And actually, thought seems to be generated in the frontal regions, which are the motor regions of the brain, basically. But then it sort of percolates into the visual region in the back and temporal area, and the hearing regions in the upper temporal area. Someday we'll understand how consciousness works, we don't yet, from a neurophysiological point of view. But in any event, we have the triple karma, karma meaning action, body, speech and mind. So we do things, we think things, and we say things intentionally. Karma means intention. Kusala akusala cetana is the definition of karma in Pali, good and bad intentions, the intentions manifesting through our actions. So we have behaviors, we do stuff. Sometimes we look back and we say, why did I do that? It's like, what was wrong with me? What's wrong with this picture? And sometimes we find ourselves saying that day after day, week after week, year after year, maybe decade after decade. Why does this pattern persist in my life, this behavior that is not kusala, it is not skillful, not productive, not helpful for me or others. So there are behaviors that we would like to improve. Well, preceding behavior is states of feel, image, talk, states of mind and body. And it turns out that there's an intimate link between one's ability to bring clarity and equanimity to feel, image, talk, and one's ability to change behaviors. There's an intimate link. However, it is not a one-to-one correspondence. The ability to track your subjective world, your mind and body, is very, very helpful in changing behavior. However, it may not be sufficient. It is possible that you may need other kinds of input besides just meditative practice. You may need counseling, you may need therapy, you may need a 12-step, you may need some sort of, you know, just a friend to talk to. There may be other things that have to come to bear in order to change behavior. However, your ability to be clear and equanimous with regard to mind and body is very relevant to the behavior change. And if your meditation is enough to cause the behavior changes, the improvements, then great, you don't need anything else. If it's not enough, then it's going to be a synergy between your meditative skills and some sort of external behaviorally oriented support, slash, input, encouragement, and what have you. So, if mind and body experience are not enough reason to do this path, then what we do in the external world, our karma, our habits, our behavior, our actions, karma means action, that should be a motivation. So, if you ever forget why to do this path, remember body, body experience, mental experience, and objective behavior. So, that's three little words.
