{"text": " There's a story from the Zen tradition that I like to tell a lot, especially at retreats. Some of you have probably already heard it a number of times, but it still bears repetition. A novice came to the master, the Zen master, and said, How do you go beyond hot and cold? Sort of interesting question. Supposing somebody came to you and said, How do you go beyond hot and cold? Or, How do you go beyond pleasure and pain? How do you go beyond inside and outside? Or, How do you go beyond heaven and hell? How do you go beyond the god or the devil? How would you respond? Well, this particular Zen master said, Why don't you go to a place where there is no hot and cold? And the monk said, What kind of place is that? And the Zen master said, When it's hot, you boil to death. When it's cold, you freeze to death. What do you think? What do you think of this story? Does it make sense? The place where there is no hot and cold, the place beyond hot and cold. You can take any pair of dualities you want. When it's hot, you boil to death. When it's cold, you freeze to death. That's a literal translation of the Chinese. Chinese idiom is very similar to English. What do you suppose it means? I sometimes, Okay, yes. Jennifer? You just become it completely, right? Of course, a little easier said than done, right? This story, though, I think it's a good one to remember. We can think of it in more familiar terms, perhaps something like you'll be sitting in the meditation hall and you're sitting at the meditation hall and somebody can't get their car started in the backyard. That's like going on five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes. Or you're sitting here and the ice cream truck with the scratchy record comes around again and again and again. Or you're sitting and next to you is somebody that is maybe really caught in their own world and whatever and they're like breathing heavy. You're sitting there for a whole half hour with nothing to hear but heavy breathing or sniffing or fidgeting next to you. Can you see it's the same situation? We come here and we tend to think, I came here to meditate, not to listen to the ice cream truck, right? I'm here to meditate, so why should I have to have the imposition of the ice cream truck or the imposition of some inconsiderate person, unconscious person, fidgeting or breathing or sniffing at me? But of course the whole issue is how we conceive of meditation. This is where we reach the difficult point because in fact there's at least a dozen completely valid ways to conceive of meditation. And really they're all facets of the same experience. So one way to conceive of meditation, among many other ways, is that meditation is a way to escape into life. The place where there is no hot and cold, where you have utterly become hot and cold, could be described as a kind of escape. There's no hot and cold as something in your way anymore. So that's an escape. But where have you escaped to? A world of wishful thinking? A never never land? Some sort of nihilistic void? Uh-uh, you've escaped into the hot, into the cold, or into the raspy car or the horn or the person next to you that's fidgeting and breathing. You've escaped into life. I sometimes find myself thinking that the Zen people don't say enough and the Vipassana people say too much. If you've been around in the Buddhist scene you'll appreciate that remark, otherwise you might not quite understand. The Zen is very suggestive. It just says something like, when it's hot you boil to death, when it's cold you freeze to death. But where do you go from there? In Vipassana everything is sort of explained in terms of techniques and whatever, and sometimes people get very caught up in the idea of techniques, stages, paths, experiences, intellectual models for what's going on and whatever. So let me perhaps say a little bit too much now, okay, speak a little bit from the Vipassana point of view. How could we, how can it be, in fact I'll ask you the question, how could it be that you can escape into something? Could you formulate that in terms of something that makes sense intellectually as a model, a description for how that could be? By the way I should say I think there's a number of ways that we could describe it. Let's say somebody were to say that's ridiculous. I can't, when it's cold I've got to either turn on the heat or get away in some way or I'll be miserable. How can I possibly escape in the cold? What does that mean? That's meaningless. That's not our human experience. But if you were to try to explain to somebody in an intellectual way how that could be, how would you go about doing it? It's quite a challenge actually, isn't it? It's a challenge to even explain it, what to say of beginning to experience it. Okay, there would, now, right, there's a way of explaining. You let go of your resistance to it, you're fighting with it, and you sort of become it. Would anybody else like to offer something? Yes. Right. But actually to do it for five seconds is not bad because most people live 50, 60, 70 years and never do it, you know, even for one second. Okay, good. What I'd like to present to you is, as I say, I think I'm going to be guilty of saying too much, but perhaps it will be of some value to somebody. One way to conceive of what it means to escape into life, as I say, this is a little bit more from the vipassana point of view. I'd like you to consider for a moment how in ordinary English we use the word real. Okay, now real, you know, is used in philosophy, it's used in science and whatever, and it's not my specialty to talk about how philosophers and scientists conceive of, quote, real. Rather, I'd like to just have us look for a moment at how the word is used in ordinary English. What I'd like to suggest to you is that one way that things are real is if they have the power to grip and hold us, okay? Like this is a real issue means I can't shake it. Have you noticed, like you'd be sitting there and, you know, there'd be sort of like a minor discomfort there, right, and you're sort of aware of it, and then it like gets bigger and stronger and more of your attention goes to it, right, and then it gets a little bigger and stronger and pretty soon it's like there is no way to pull away from it in any way whatsoever. It's just all that there is in the universe, and it's got this, like this gravitational field or this gripping power that holds or rivets our awareness. Have you all noticed that? Okay. So on one hand we can say something is, in the ordinary use of English, something is real to us or the reality of something is a function of how tightly it can hold us in its grip and for how long it can hold us in its grip, okay? It's like something happens and you realize, oh, I'm going to be thinking about this for the next week, okay, or the next month. That's very real, right, because it somehow has the ability to not only to grip but to grip for like a frightening length of time, okay, or we get intimidated by the idea that consciousness is going to be held for this length of time, gripped by this experience or concern or what have you. So one way that things get real is in terms of how long they can grip our awareness. On the other hand, there's another way that we use the word real, which is actually quite different. If you don't know me and you meet me, I become a little more real to you. And then if we start to have interactions, we hang out together, we go through various life experiences together, I become more and more real to you, correct? Or if you haven't been to Thailand, most of you probably haven't, Thailand's not too real to you. India's not too real to you. But when you have been there, you like, I mean, for myself, it was just a few years ago I went to India. Before that, it wasn't real. But I'll tell you, if you've ever been to India, after you've been there, it's very real, okay, it's very, very real. So another sense of real is sort of the fullness with which we've experienced something, or the richness of that experience, how much we've actually contacted it. Now let's take some ordinary event, could be anything at all, could be something that's pleasant, could be something unpleasant, could be something completely neutral. Let's start with something neutral. Let's start with the event of, shall we say, breathing, we could take walking, we could take just about anything, we could take the event of the chair touching your body, we could take anything at all. Let's just take breathing. I can begin to have, cultivate a certain kind of awareness with respect to breathing. I can be aware of the in-breath and the out-breath. That's just for argument's sake to say that in and out takes a certain length of time. Now if I'm not aware at all, let's say, then I have no information about the breath. But I could begin to become aware by feeling the in-breath as distinct and the out-breath as distinct. Then in the time of one cycle of breath, I would have two moments of awareness. So the breath would become a little more real to me in that sense. Now could I also be aware not only of the in-breath and the out-breath, how that felt, but also how the transition from in to out, out to in feels? Yeah, I might be able to be aware that there's a sort of quality of sensation that goes at the end, that comes at the end of the in-breath, and another quality of sensation that comes at the end of the out-breath, sort of transition quality. Then in the length of time of one breath cycle, I would have four pieces of experience. So the breath would be a little more real to me. Now could I also be aware of, let us say, the beginning, the middle, and end of the in-breath, the beginning, middle, and end of the out-breath? Yes, because the breath is a constantly changing quantity. Therefore its rate is different at the beginning, middle, and end. And because the speed of the air column varies, the quality of sensation varies. Now it may seem like a very trivial thing, but it is different. And therefore one could be aware at all those different points. Now in a single cycle of breath, I would touch the reality, or I would have a richness of experience or a contact with it, eight times. So I'd have eight bits of information, you might say. So the breath has become even more real to me in the sense of contact. Does that make sense? You start out, there's no awareness, then you're aware of in and out, you touch it twice, then you touch it four times, then you touch it eight times. Could I touch it ten times or sixteen times? Well yes. Now there may not even be human words to describe all of those subtle permutations, but awareness can be there. So as a person is contacting the breath more and more continuously, in a sense we could say the breath is at that moment, at that time, is becoming more and more real. That's a neutral object. Let's take a non-neutral object. Let's take a feeling of irritation, let's say. You're sitting there and something starts to bug you. Or let's take my last experience. I was just sitting there for two hours. By the end of the two hours there was pain in this body. How real was the pain? Well, I could just sort of sit there and in a vague sense know I'm suffering, but I could also start to become aware of the individual risings and passings of sensation in different parts of the body. For example, over a period of let's say five seconds there might be a distinct rising and passing here, another distinct rising and passing here. And at the same time, throughout my whole body, there might be a dozen little tense reactions, very, very subtle, fine material in response to those grosser sensations in my legs. So there'd be, okay, say one big thing coming up here, another big thing coming up here, and then I could be aware of several smaller things going on in the body in a certain cycle of time. Now, can I refine that further? Yes. Maybe associated with this big thing happening here was a sort of little bud on this side and a little trickle on that side. And in addition to the few larger things I saw over my whole body, there might be wispier, finer material still happening. So maybe in the period of five seconds I could be aware of a dozen or two dozen distinct types of events going on, some very, very rapid, coming in two flavors. One flavor, a gross physical pain in the leg. Another flavor, sort of subtle reactive tensions in the body. Were there other flavors going on simultaneously? Yes. It was a little cold. And there was sort of goose flesh kinds of feelings going on. And those were happening at the same time. And then there was noise, which was bugging me, okay? And that caused another flavor, a really different flavor of sensation, which was an irritated kind of feeling. So there were at least four different flavors of sensation. Gross physical pain, subtle tension all over the body in response to that pain, feelings of cold that were happening in different parts of the body, and the goings and comings of feelings of being irritated by noises going on. Four flavors of sensation arising in different locations and at different scales, some large, some small. Now if I were to attend to each one of those and be distinctly aware of each size, each flavor, and each location, I could perhaps be aware of, as I say, when I start the crudest awareness, I might only be able to be aware of like one or two, I might only be aware I'm suffering, okay? That would be the crudest approximation. I'm suffering. This is horrible. Let me out of here, okay? The next level or refinement is there's something happening here, there's something happening here, and there's a couple other things happening here. The next level of refinement is there's something happening here and around it, something here and here, and something here and here, and not only are there a few things going on, but there's actually about a dozen little tensions here, and there's about five or six little goose flushes happening, okay? And there's these little irritated feelings. So maybe you're aware of a dozen things simultaneously. And then the next level of refinement, maybe two dozen things in just a five-second interval. Again, maybe so fine and so ineffable that we might not be able to describe it in words, but the awareness can be there. So can you see that in a sense, my discomfort is becoming more and more real, right? In the sense that I'm more and more in contact with it in a specific or precise way. Let's take a pleasant thing, okay? It's exactly the same. Most people, when they eat their food, they say it's enjoyable, but how real is that joy? Well, there's taste, and then there's pleasant sensations that fill the body. That's a first approximation. The next approximation, there's taste on the top of the mouth, on the side of the mouth, on the bottom of the mouth. Those are different tastes, okay? And there's sort of a warm feeling in the chest and maybe a fulfilled feeling going down the spine, you know? There's several different things happening. And the next approximation, all that stuff could be broken down into finer wavelets, okay? Dozens, perhaps. Ultimately, in a single bite of food, there may be several dozen distinct wavelets of pleasant sensations. Very seldom does anybody experience each one distinctly, but it's part of the reality. Each one is distinct. It's what's happening. Now, if you could feel all of that, could we not say that the experience of enjoying your food has become more and more real? Well, yes. So I've given you a neutral example, an unpleasant example, and a pleasant example. This is real in the sense of richness of experience. But now let's just go back to the breath for a moment and look at it from another perspective. Or actually, let's take, it'll be a little more realistic. Let's take the experience of the pain. I just gave you a fairly vivid description of what my last half hour was. You might say that the discomfort in my body was very, very real. On the other hand, I said that in a period of perhaps five seconds, at first I could maybe be aware of, let's say, one thing, okay? So that one thing was gripping my awareness for five whole seconds. But then maybe as my meditation deepened, in a period of five seconds I could distinguish, let's say, five things happening in sequence, okay? Something here, then something here, then something here. Broke it down. Well, that would mean that each one of those experiences could only grip my awareness for one fifth of a second, okay? Because in order to move on to the next stage of the unfolding experience, I'd have to, I couldn't hold for more than a second, otherwise I wouldn't be able to be there for the next detail in the arising of the experience. Now supposing that in a period of five seconds, ten distinct details unfold sequentially. Well then I can only allow myself to be gripped by each one for one half of a second, right? If I were to hold for more than a half a second, I couldn't be there to be fully present for the next detail. Follow what I'm saying? Now what if we carry the sequence a little further? Say that in a five second interval, one is aware of a sequence of twenty details, twenty permutations, twenty changes. Then each one of those experiences can only be held for one fourth of a second. Now remember that one measure of quote reality in the ordinary sense of the word real is how long something can grip you, okay? So from another point of view, what we're describing here is a sequence of diminishing intervals of time, shorter and shorter intervals of time, over which something has gripping power. In other words, if you want to be in the moment with something, as you get more and more detail or richness of the experience, you are forced to not hold on instant by instant to what you have just experienced, or you can't be there for the next instant, next instant, next instant. Or since the gripping durations are shortening, that experience is becoming in the aggregate less and less in the way. And in that second sense of real, or rather in the first sense of real, something is real if it can grip me. The experience is becoming less and less real. So we have a paradox here. Realism is full of very interesting paradoxes. And this paradox, which was recognized in the East and West, is sometimes called the paradox of the whole and the void, or the all and the nothing. I just happen to use the word real here to describe the paradox. We could say it's the paradox of the real and the unreal. Mystics will describe, they say that they're really hearing the bell, okay? Or they're really experiencing another person for the first time. And in the next breath they'll say that the bell is empty, the other person is empty and that there's no self, okay? Well, think about the two senses of real and you might be able to understand how this paradox comes about. On one hand, as I was describing this sequence of refinement of awareness, I was describing a sequence where the experience becomes more and more real in the sense of richer and richer and richer. On the other hand, I was in the same breath describing a sequence where the experience is becoming less and less real in the sense of how long any piece of it can grip you and solidify the flow of awareness. Now there's a certain cutoff point, a certain threshold where the awareness becomes complete, okay? The richness becomes complete. And that exact same cutoff point happens to be the cutoff point where the length of time that you're holding anything effectively drops to zero. Okay, so at that point we could say you've had a complete experience of sitting there in pain and we could also say that that experience had no extension in time whatsoever. Time just collapsed around it, okay? I know some people are saying, what? What is he talking about? I know we tend to think that time and space are out there, we're embedded in time and space. This is a very, very hard preconception to rid ourselves of. How can time and space collapse? I'm in time and space, it's there, all right? I open my eyes and I'm in this room, so it seems. And you came here half an hour ago or an hour ago and now you're in this duration of time and then I'll stop talking and then you'll leave here. And you're embedded in time, embedded in space. It's a very, very strong, strong perception. What I would like to suggest to you, however, is that whatever time and space may be to the physicist or philosopher, which is not my bailiwick to know, our subjective experience of time and space is in essence a function of microscopic tension in the nervous system, okay? What makes time and space seem to be a rigid container for us is in fact just the rigidity or the congealing around the flow of awareness. And as that breaks down, we get another very different experience of time and space. And I won't go into a whole lot of detail other than to say it's very refreshing, a very refreshing experience of time and space, which is to say the experience of time and space being created and dissolved constantly. So what happens is when you experience something with continuity of awareness, since there's no time to latch on to any little piece of that experience, any little detail, the whole experience collapses into something that is timeless and spaceless. Needless to say, therefore, there can be no sense of a you and an object, correct? The separation between self, the observer, and the quote observed comes about through the solidification of the sense of space. In the first story that I gave you about the Zen master, when he said, the place where there is no hot and cold, when it's hot you boil to death, okay? Boil to death, okay? The space, you disappear. What you have to also understand is that the heat disappears also at the same time as an object. Disappears into what? Disappears into fullness. I know that sounds very, very weird. It's like when I started meditation, I used to hear my teacher say these things and it used to really piss me off. It's like, well, why do they have to say... I thought they were just making up really fun mind games to sort of twist your mind around and it's like saying things that were contradictory and whatever. I said, why don't they just explain straightforward what this is like? Why do they have to say it so weird and in such a confusing way? It's very interesting. As the years pass and whatever, now I find myself saying the same weird things that used to piss me off and struggling in trying to get more and more simple, more and more straightforward and it sounds weirder and weirder, more and more contradictory. But basically, this is what is meant by escaping into the world. The experience is so full that it is no longer solidified and it takes on a different quality, a fluid quality. Well, why is it that the sense of self disappears? Well, or rather, if I say the sense of self disappears, then everybody freaks out. Okay. Well, who wants that? But remember, the sense of self disappears only in the sense that I've just said, that you have such a full experience of yourself that it's no longer solidified, therefore it's no longer held out in time and space, you might say. So it's not exactly that you're taking some sort of eraser, nihilistic philosophical eraser and trying to erase the sense of self. Rather, in point of fact, you're just trying to be yourself fully. But that's an awesome thing, when people in very casual ways will speak about, you know, oh yeah, you should really be yourself, you should fully express your personality. Somebody that's meditated for many, many years hears a phrase like fully express your personality. That means something very special to a meditator, okay, to fully, people that can fully express their personality. Well, first of all, if you can fully express your personality, you do not express the personality. You experience your personality arising as an expression of nature. So you experience God, quote, whatever word you want to use, God or nature, manifesting your personality. So that's the first thing. It's not you doing it, okay. Because if there were any you expressing the personality, then there'd be push and pull. There'd be a sense of congealing around that, you know, because there'd be an investment. Oh, I want to be this kind of way. I want to be this way. I don't want to be that way. To really express the personality means a 100% non-involvement with the flow of the personality. So there can't be any sense of controller. There's just a sense of nature moves and the personality is formed like a sculptor forming an image. And the other thing is that when a person fully expresses their personality, because the personality is complete in that moment, whatever that expression may be, you know, talking to this person, looking over there, you know, eating their bagel, whatever it is, when the personality is expressed fully, it becomes totally real and totally unreal in exactly the sense that I just described to you. And that's why half the mystics talk about realizing the true self and the other half of the mystics talk and say you have to realize there's truly no self. It's very confusing. Very, very confusing. You think they're playing games. But we're still the same mystic. One day says you have to realize the true self and the next day says you have to realize there truly is no self. And you wonder why. What are these guys talking about? So when there's a full experience of hot and cold, there has to be also a full experience of the self experiencing hot and cold. And those two full experiences are not separate. And that's like when they say when it's hot you boil to death. When it's cold you freeze to death. How to go about achieving this? Well as far as I'm concerned, my basic answer to that is predictable. It's practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. It's sort of interesting. I read, I think, one of the best descriptions in terms of giving a person an idea of how you cultivate this kind of awareness. And it was by Krishnamurti, who paradoxically advocated no practice, supposedly, but actually it's not true. He was talking to a group of school children and they asked him to explain what he meant by choiceless awareness or what meditation means. And I'm paraphrasing, but in essence he said you should very carefully observe the thoughts and the feelings, the mind and the body. I'm paraphrasing, but it's something to that effect. Very carefully observe. So how? Well, he said, imagine that you were watching a lizard on the wall. And you were to watch that lizard very, very carefully so as to not miss any teeny little thing that that lizard did. So if the lizard cocked its head, you were aware it cocked its head. If it blinks its eye, you were aware it blinks its eye. If it moves one of its toes, if it wiggles its tail. If it crawls this way, it crawls that way. Just imagine you were to watch every macroscopic and microscopic movement of that lizard. That's the way to observe the mind-body process, to observe your own self, you might say. And I think that's a very vivid, it really gives you an idea of what it's like. As I'm saying these words, each body in this room is moving in little, big and little ways. Can you watch it like a lizard on a wall? As I'm saying these words, the mind is comprehending them. And it's moving here, moving there. Oh, that makes sense. Oh, that doesn't make sense. Oh, what's he going to say next? And it's moving in big and small ways like a lizard on a wall. And if that wasn't enough, simultaneously feelings are arising. If I say something that is interesting, there's a little pleasant thing, okay? And those little pleasant feelings move too. If I say something that's confusing, there's little tensions arising in the body. If I say something you violently disagree with, there's strong tensions arising. And those tensions move around in big and little ways too. One can observe them like a lizard on a wall. So actually, that's where it becomes a little difficult because we have to observe, well, five or six lizards simultaneously to really get good at it, okay? Because we have the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. You can consider them six different lizards or you can consider them just one lizard with six limbs or what have you, appendages, let's say. That's the way to do this, okay? And as you're watching all those big and small permutations of the mind-body process, you're starting to develop an awareness whereby this moment will become more and more real to you and paradoxically at the same time, it will become less and less real. And when that process reaches a certain cutoff point, a certain absolute value, if you will, then you have the experience which is complete, therefore it is fulfilling. One is complete with it. And at the same time, you have the experience which is empty, okay? Just refreshing and not in the way at all. Free, in other words. And this is what we might describe as escape into the world. It's a sense of just total freedom, the sense of total completeness, that's the escape, okay? The neat thing is, though, that it was life, okay? It escaped into life, just some event of life. So it affirms what we humans have to do, which is live our lives. Now I would consider this to be one of the great discoveries of our species. In essence, what it's saying is that you can have your cake and eat it too, okay? We use that phrase to mean have two things simultaneously that you think would be contradictory. A person can be, for lack of a better phrase, be in constant contact with God, if you wanted to use those. That's not the Buddhist phrase, but some people use that, the ground of the being. And at the same time, have that be through just hearing the sound of the car. So that's like having your cake and eating it too, you might say. I once was translating for Sasaki Roshi, Roshi Sasaki, the abbot of Mount Baldy, and we were in Puerto Rico, actually. So it was a complicated translation. He was going Japanese, and I put it into English, and then somebody else put it into Spanish. And a Catholic priest was in the audience and said to the Roshi, what is your experience of God? And without any hesitation, Roshi picked up the cup that was on the table. It was a cup of tea, okay? And he said, ah. That was his answer.
