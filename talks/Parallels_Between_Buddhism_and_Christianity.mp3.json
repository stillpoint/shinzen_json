{"text": " I really got tripped out by the thought when I went down to the dining hall of, wow, isn't this neat? The fathers have provided kosher lepessakh matzot for the Jewish Buddhist meditators. And it got me sort of thinking about the whole process of history and how things change and evolve and I mean things that you couldn't even conceive of a few hundred years ago are now just the norm, you know, and no one even thinks it's strange. I could just imagine, you know, Saint Ignatius of Loyola or something back in the 16th century, the Counter-Reformation, if he knew what was going to happen in the next few hundred years, they wouldn't be able to relate to it at all. So it really, as I say, got me thinking about what in Buddhism is called anicca or impermanence, how things change. And then I was in my interview room and you know how I always talk about escaping into, right? You've probably heard me talk about that, right? It's one of my favorite expressions, like, you know, Buddhist meditation is escaping into things, not escaping from them. It is truly an escape, it's a transcendence, but not a denial. It's 180 degrees the opposite direction of denial. So then I see this book InScape, okay? Right here, it's part of the reading for the fathers and it's by another father who actually lives in my part of the country. His name is George Maloney, SJ. Most of you probably know what SJ means, if you don't, it's Societas Jesus, it's the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits. He wrote this book called InScape, God at the Heart of Matter, okay? And it's all on that theme of escaping into things. And what's interesting is he has written another book, which I think is one of the best introductions to the Christian contemplative tradition. It's called Prayer of the Heart. And it's actually, even though he's a Jesuit and a Roman Catholic, the book Prayer of the Heart is primarily about the Eastern Orthodox tradition of Christian meditation. And as far as I'm concerned, it's there that the most powerful forms of meditation were practiced. I think most of you probably know what Eastern Orthodox Christianity is. Actually, we passed on the way out here a Ukrainian Orthodox church, a really big, beautiful one. I was surprised, like, you know, it's like, wow. Because you can always tell the Orthodox churches, they have a different kind of cross. It's got an extra bar on the bottom that's slanted obliquely. So the Orthodox tradition in Christianity is a form of Catholicism, but it's not centered on Rome. Each local ethnos or nation has its own independent Orthodox church. So there's a Greek Orthodox, a Russian Orthodox, a Ukrainian Orthodox, and I think there's like, you know, some of the smaller countries in that part of the world, Eastern Europe, have their own Orthodox churches. But historically, Orthodox Christianity is geographically the closest to where Christianity started, which is the Holy Land. And it grew up in the deserts of Egypt and in Palestine and those areas. So from a sort of objective, external point of view, we might expect that the area that was closest to the historical center of Christianity might in some ways preserve earlier forms or historically deeper forms of the religion. So what's interesting is that in the various Orthodox traditions, they practiced and continue to practice a form of spirituality that's remarkably similar to Vipassana meditation. And what I did once is I took this same man's book, Father Maloney's book, The Prayer of the Heart, and being a Jesuit, he's an intellectual, so he has all the Greek terminology. You know, there's an expression, it's not much used much now, but I think it may be from Shakespeare, that the Greeks have a name for it, the Greeks have a word for it. You may have heard that. Is it from Shakespeare? Okay. By the way, it may have been Shakespeare that said it, but I'm sure that the person that originally said it was a Roman. Because you may or may not be aware, but in the classical tradition of Europe, the Romans more or less copied everything that was Greek. They looked upon the Greeks as having a true civilization. And a lot of our so-called Latin words are just translations, literal translations of Greek words. So they looked upon the Greeks as having very rich and penetrating vocabulary about all aspects of human experience. So true to form in the West, the Greeks do have a word for it. There is a copious technical vocabulary of internal exploration in Greek from the Middle Ages, from the monastic tradition. And Maloney in that book has a lot of their main buzzwords. So what I did is I went through and I just took all the italicized words, all the foreign words, the Greek words that he had in, it was a little book like this, and it was a list of about 20 words. And then right next to them, I put the Pali and Sanskrit equivalents. And it just lined up one to one. It was just really, really interesting to see the parallelism. For example, the main practice in Orthodox Christian meditation is to develop something called isikhiya, that would be written H-E-S-I-C-H-I-A. And in the anglicized pronunciation, it's given us the word hesychasm. I don't know how many of you have ever heard the word H-E-S-A-C-H-A-S-M. Is that correct? I think so. Hesychasm. You might look it up in the dictionary. Hesychasm means the practice of hesychia or quieting the mind. Hesychasm means the aspect of spirituality that involves calming the mind. In other words, what we call samadhi or shamatha. And a person that practices that is called a hesychast. H-E-S-A-C-H-A-S-T. You can find these words in the unabridged English dictionary. I bring it up because I think it's very significant, it's very important that since we are Westerners, to know that there is a Western analog to the work that we're doing. You may ask why in that case, since we grew up in the West and most of us, not all of us, not myself, but probably most of you grew up in the Christian tradition, why you've never heard of it. Why you're not intimately informed about this if this was part and parcel of Christianity. And I'll go into that in just a second. But in any event, hesychia or isychia, if you want to use the modern Greek pronunciation, hesychasm is the development of states of calm and concentration through practices rather similar to what we do. And they would sit in certain postures that were stable, just like ours, yogic type postures. I shouldn't put it in the past tense, it's still done. There's a place in Greece called Mount Athos where people still do this quite avidly. It's interesting apropos of what's been going on in the Soviet Union. In the 19th century, meditation practice, concentrative meditation practice, was quite prevalent in Russia. And you can read a book about it. I mean prevalent among the householders, the average peasant. There's a very interesting book called The Way of the Pilgrim, which is about a Russian peasant in the 19th century who gets initiated into this practice of hesychastic prayer. And all of the stages and experiences that he goes through in developing this. But what you had was, you had what they called a starets. I don't know how many of you have any Slavic background. A starets means an elder, in other words, a spiritual director. And that exactly corresponds to the Pollywood tera. Tera means an elder or a spiritual director. As you may or may not know, the Vipassana tradition is derived from the Theravada school of Buddhism. So you have in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, you have a starets or a guru, an elder, a thera, a teacher, that directs you along this long path of developing hesychasm or deep inner quiet. But what's interesting is, not only did they develop the states of calm and concentration that are the hallmark, of course, of Buddhist meditation, but they did much more than that. They purified consciousness. And the word for purification is catharsis. So that's where that has a deep medieval meaning that's similar to what we, our meaning of visuddhi in Pali or purification. And the way that you did the purification was to go into the state of hesychia or deep quiet. And then within that state, you would do something that in Greek is called nepsis, N-E-P-S-I-S, usually translated into English as sober observation. Sound familiar? Okay. Sober observation. You would observe very carefully. And you would observe with a quality that the medieval writers in Greek struggled greatly to convey to people. It was a quality of detachment without being indifferent. And it was, they wrote about how difficult it was to distinguish this detachment from indifference. Does this sound familiar? Does this sound like the rap about equanimity? Okay. Well, it is. But the interesting thing is the Greek word for equanimity has completely shifted in modern English. But in medieval English, I mean in medieval Greek, in the setting of Christian meditation, the word for equanimity was apatheia, which has given us the modern English word apathy, which is very much not the meaning that they would have had. But it's interesting. Whenever you deal with words, you have to always be aware that a word doesn't have any meaning outside of the tradition, the context, the historical period, the teacher who's speaking, and the audience that's being addressed. You have to take all of those things into consideration if you want to develop a maturity to be able to understand the deep spiritual writings around the world. There's no such thing as a meaning to samadhi. It's only samadhi used within a certain tradition at a certain period by a certain teacher speaking to a certain audience. That's what that word means in that situation. So case in point is the word apathy, which actually meant equanimity in medieval Christianity. So you would cultivate this quality of apatheia. You would have a sober observation, a nepsis within a state of deep ezekia or calm. In other words, it was a kind of vipassana. One of the main things that they attended to was the sensations in their viscera and in their heart and their guts. What's interesting is that they would, of course, attend to it with mindfulness and equanimity, body sensation, especially body sensation. As you probably noticed, this part of the body tends to have a lot of chakras. There's a lot of emotional stuff that comes in. So they would watch with equanimity. In order to do it, they would actually sometimes sort of sit in a yogic posture and turn their head down and actually look at their heart or look at their abdomen and be very still and just let the sensations bubble up and observe them. Well, what's interesting is that the more head-oriented monks who tended to be a little bit more in Western Europe than in the East, they couldn't understand \u2013 this is, we're talking a thousand years ago \u2013 some of them couldn't understand why these people would sit around, why the Greeks, the Eastern Christians, why they would sit around and observe their body sensations, especially observing their belly and this kind of stuff. It didn't make any sense. If your experience of religion is all ideas, beliefs, then you can't understand. It seems, in fact, that a person is miring themselves in the physical body. And maybe you yourself have wondered. I thought spirituality was to get me beyond the body. Why am I paying attention, making the body so real? But of course, the body is where feeling comes up. And our primordial ego blockages, the things that originally separated us from the Source, came about through holdings around feeling. The separation from our spiritual source started in infancy. The baby looks at a flame and the baby is the flame and the flame is God. And since the baby is the flame, it reaches out to touch itself and has sensation. And then the next time it looks at the flame, the flame isn't quite so much God and quite so much the baby, because there's a residue. The pain wasn't fully experienced and it left a residue. And so a sense of separation, I'm not the flame. Or the baby looks at the wall and is the wall until one day mother goes behind the wall and the wall gets in the way of the baby and mother. And then the wall is not the baby anymore. It's a source of fear or a source of limitation or something solid that you can bang up against or can confine you in some way. So the infant passes through feeling states and they leave residues. And as a result of that, the primordial oneness outside the sense of connectedness with everything and inside the connectedness with the spiritual source becomes alienated. So by paying attention to the body sensations, the blockages are broken up because whatever residues remain from the past can be broken up by experiencing the present skillfully. You don't have to do anything else. It'll eventually percolate up in the present. Also, of course, if you bring enough mindfulness and equanimity to anything, that thing becomes complete and at the same time becomes empty. It's a completeness that is an emptiness. It sounds like playing with words. It sounds like a game of the mind playing with paradoxes. But it's not a game of the mind. It's just the most straightforward description I could think of. So what we're trying to do is have a complete experience of the body, which is a true experience of no body. You can sit and be distracted or lose contact with your somatic afferent, your body input, and it can seem like you don't have a body, but if I sneak up on you with a pin and stick you, your body is going to come back really quick with a vengeance. On the other hand, if you have learned how to have a complete experience of your body, the body is clarified in the two senses of the English word clear. Something is clear when all the components are distinct, but also something is clear when it is no longer opaque. Those are the two meanings of the English word clear. Our language can be very revealing. We're clarifying the body in both senses of the word. One leads to the other. When all the components, subcomponents and subcomponents are totally distinct, then the body actually becomes literally transparent. That's an experience of escaping into the body, which is a true no body experience. It's a realization that there never was a body. There was only incomplete feeling. That's a mouthful right there, isn't it? But anyway, when you have that experience, if somebody sneaks up behind you with a pin and sticks you, all that happens is that there is a beautiful shimmering and rippling of pure energy. That's inscaping into the body. The same is true for any experience. This is the central paradox or conundrum of meditation. We have this experience that's so deeply satisfying and spiritual, and yet at the same time is so empty and insubstantial. I should say one more thing. The ultimate goal, according to the medieval Christian concept, at least from the orthodox Catholic point of view, the ultimate goal of the meditation path is something that in Greek is called theosis, related to the word theos, of course, meaning God, as in theology. It's funny, when you say it in Greek, it sounds quite reasonable, theosis. But when you translate it literally into the Latin, it sounds pretty shocking from a Western point of view, because the Latin translation for theosis would be, of course, deification, you becoming godlike. And when you say it in Latin, it sounds almost heretical. When you say it in Greek, it sounds quite reasonable, theosis. It's a godding process. By the way, I wonder if anybody knows what the Greek word for meditation is. There is a generic term for meditation. Very interesting. We talked about semantic shifts, how meanings of words shift historically. The Greek word for meditation is theoria, t-h-e-o-r-i-a, which is exactly the English word theory. And what does theory mean, literally in Greek? It comes from one of the umpteen million Greek words that means to see. There's about a dozen different words in Greek that mean to see, and this is one of them. So actually, theory or theoria was something that you saw clearly, something you contemplated or meditated about, so that you had a clarity of seeing. Now, what does that sound like? Clarity of seeing? Right? So actually, the Greek translation for vipassana is theoria, is theory, in the literal sense of it. In any event, I find it utterly fascinating that people that never heard of Buddhism, and in fact would have thought that all Buddhists are going to hell, came up with a system so remarkably parallel. It indicates to me that there's something quite universal going on here, quite independent of cultures and of dogmatic systems. So now we come to the interesting question of why it is that if this was part and parcel for many, many centuries, not peripheral but central to the Western tradition, and we are Westerners, why didn't we grow up with this stuff? Why do we have to go to Buddhism? And the reason is because of the various political fracases in the history of Christianity. Because there's religion and then there's history. And religion is a two-sided sword. I used to teach comparative religion at college, and I would tell my students that the basic theme in all study of all religion, in all cultures, in all times, if you want one underlying theme to look for, to unify the whole picture of human religion in all of its aspects, is that religion is a two-edged sword. It cuts two ways. One way, it's a vehicle that takes people beyond their egos. And the other side of religion is that it is a vehicle to affirm people's egos. It can be used either way. And that's true of every religion, and certainly that is true of Buddhism. So it's either something that shows you the way beyond your ego, or it's a tool that you can use to get what you want, to affirm what you already want, something in service of your ego. Have you noticed that that's true? It's true at every level of spiritual practice. It's true at the conceptual level. You can use the concepts, take a concept like no-self, a very great concept. You can use that to realize that when you're suffering, there's no one suffering, and you can become a free and beautiful human being based on that concept. But that very same concept can also be used along the lines of there's no self inside people, so you're not killing anybody when you participate in imperialistic wars, etc., etc. The same concept, one used to transcend the small self, the other used to affirm the greed and hatred of political demagogues. That's why Zen, after World War II, Zen was unpopular for a while in Japan, because it had been used as a philosophical underpinning for fascism. Does that mean Zen's bad? No. It just means like any other tool, it can be used or abused. So you may find yourself using and abusing the concepts of your spiritual path. And then at the level of Samadhi, which is the next level beyond concept when you develop high concentration power, it's great. You have a vehicle to really live your life. You also have a super-duper denial mechanism available to you. Is it good to be able to have a calm mind? Yeah. If we can't, we'll never really be human beings. On the other hand, the ability to stop your thought is the ability to turn off your conscience. Can't have one without the other, therefore are you going to misuse that? Yeah. You're going to, for sure. Everyone does. The issue is a matter of proportion. You may occasionally, once or twice, abuse that Samadhi power. That's okay, as long as you properly use it a billion times. But you have to realize you will misuse that tool. At every level, conceptual, at the level of Samadhi, and then at the level of Prajna, of wisdom, of enlightenment itself. Even enlightenment can be abused. But again, it's a matter of degree. Enlightenment just means that you're able to function from the no-self. But that doesn't mean that everything that you say or do is right. It just means that there's no attachment to the mind and body as you speak. But because there's a certain power in the presence of a person that's in the no-self, people will tend to believe just about everything they say. They'll believe that because that person has liberated their political views, it must be correct because they're enlightened. Or their sense of humor must be the right kind of sense of humor. Or if they drink, then that's what enlightened people do, so it's okay to drink, etc., etc. Anyway, I don't want to get too far off the subject, but religion is a two-edged sword, and it can be used or abused. And the trick is to accept that fact and recognize in yourself and in others when the legitimate tool is either being used or being abused. But there's a phrase in law, I think it goes something like, abusus non tolit usus, or something like that, which means the fact that something is abused doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with it per se. Okay, so in any event, religion is a two-edged sword, and when we look at the history of the Western religions or of Christianity, you can see both of those edges just as you can if you look at the history of Buddhism. And what happened was that certain conflicts developed, as they inevitably do, between different groups, different cultures, and whatever, and then religion gets mixed up in it, and then pretty soon you have religious wars and heresies and all sorts of stuff. So the first split that took place was actually between the people that had this idea about penetrating into your body sensations versus the more head-oriented forms of spirituality, and that plus some other stuff eventually led to a split within Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox on one hand and the Roman Catholic on the other. And what's interesting is that some of the Western European monks made fun of the Eastern monks' way of meditating. They said, and when you hear this phrase you'll understand again another interesting origin of words in our English language. They called the people that sat around and practiced equanimity with their body sensations, especially what's happening in the center of their body, they said, you people are omphaloskeptikos, in Greek. And I don't know if you know what omphalos means, but anyway, omphaloskeptikos means belly button gazers. And you know that phrase, sit around and contemplate your navel? It comes from a thousand years ago, from the misunderstandings about two different ways of meditating within Catholic Christianity. So there was a split, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic. Then approximately 500 years later, another huge split, Protestantism versus Catholicism. That took place in the 16th century and some historians of Western thought referred to the 16th century rather descriptively as the age of intolerance. That was the age of reformation and the counter-reformation, warfare based on religious ideas that affected all of Europe and in some sense the whole world. Well, what happened was one of the main casualties of the age of intolerance was the entire meditative tradition within Christianity. It's not designed for an age of intolerance. Meditation opens people up to possibility. It clears their minds out. And if you're interested in filling up people's minds with certain doctrines to save their souls, it doesn't fit with what's called the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. And it was a casualty of the 16th century basically. And what I find historically very ironic and also very interesting and amusing is that the older orders within Christianity that practiced, even the Roman Catholics definitely practiced mind quieting meditations. They may not have observed the body quite the way that the Eastern Orthodox did, but they definitely had what they called the oratio quies, the prayer of quiet, the state of recollection of high concentration. Saint Benedict, who's very Western European, said that the only purpose to become a monk or a nun was to attain the prayer of quiet and to attain something called conversio mores, which means a transformation and refinement of your very essence of your being. In other words, what we call purification. But in other words, mores, M-O-R-E-S, so conversio mores, a transformation in your very basic personality. So in any event, the older orders, particularly if you're familiar with what's called the Carmelites, orders like the Carmelites, the Benedictines, the Carmelites produced two of the most outstanding of all of the saints who were Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Avila. Saint Teresa of Avila has the interesting distinction of being the only woman doctor of the church. What does that mean? There are certain individuals that are looked upon as the ultimate authority in certain areas in the Catholic Church. And the only woman that I know of that is given that position is Saint Teresa of Avila, 16th century Spanish Carmelite. But what's really rather amazing is the area in which she's given ultimate authority. It is the meditative path. So despite all the patriarchism and whatever, when it comes to meditation, it turns out that the doctor of the church is a woman. So anyway, the older orders like the Carmelites, their form of meditation was eclipsed and replaced by the new 16th century force to be dealt with, which was the Jesuit order, SJ. And for those of you that went to Catholic school, you probably know the term Jebi. Anyway, be that as it may, which is somewhat of a pejorative. The Jesuits, I think, were primarily responsible for the destruction of the meditative tradition within Christianity because they sort of replaced the older emptying kinds of meditation with mind-filling kinds of meditation. And besides, they had some political enemies that they didn't get along with who happened to practice the older mind-emptying forms of meditation. And so if you've got some enemies that you don't get along with, the way to deal with them in those days was to get them declared heretics. And they did. And there was a bogus heresy created called quietism. Now because it was truly a bogus heresy and based on political motives, there is no real way that you can tell the difference between quietism as a heresy and the traditional Christian prayer of quiet because there is no difference. So therefore, from the 16th century on, anybody that wants to calm their mind is skirting the edges of possible heresy in Christianity. Well obviously, this is ludicrous, but it went on for several centuries. And basically, the second Vatican council, which you remember, Pope John XXIII, I'm sure you remember. I'm sure we would not be using this facility if it was not for Pope John XXIII. We would be in those categories of schismatics and heretics. But anyway, what that was all about was to basically undo the Council of Trent, which brought about all of this counter-reformation stuff. So in any event, why I even mention this is just to show you how history all turns around and apropos of just everything, the matzahs and everything. George Maloney is a Jesuit. What happened was, yes indeed, the Jesuits were the shock troops of the counter-reformation and they sort of undid a lot of the quieting meditative tradition that had been central within Christianity. And so that's basically why you haven't heard about this stuff so much. The Council of Trent was the Catholic Church's war camp to formulate a strategy for stopping Protestantism, the spread of Protestant Christianity. So obviously, there's two things you want to do if you want to stop Protestantism. One is you want to win back Europe, Germany and all those places, because that obviously didn't work too well. The other is you want to beat the Protestant missionaries to the punch for the rest of the world. You want to get there before they do and get there in a better shape than they do so that you can convert the people in India, the people in China, the people in Japan and the people in the new world, the Western Hemisphere, before the Protestants get to them. So the Jesuits were the missionaries and they were the best intellects in Catholic Europe at that time. They were sent out, yes indeed, to convert the non-Western world to Catholicism, but to do it with class. What they would do is they would go into a culture and they would master the language, they would master the forms of that culture, they would become of that culture, except they were Christian. Their philosophy for spreading Christianity was that you, it's the original trickle-down theory. It was in stark contrast to the Franciscans. You know like Friar Tuck was a Franciscan. The Franciscan policy was, hey, you go to a country and you stand on the first street corner you can and you just start precoiting the gospel and then people will follow. The Jesuit policy was you go to a country and you spend years mastering the classical tradition of that country so that you can converse with the social, spiritual, and intellectual elite of that country and political elite of that country. You convert them and it trickles down. Interesting, different ideas about things. So here you are a Jesuit, you're in China, you're in Japan, you're in India. These are cultures that are certainly as civilized as Europe, certainly have greater antiquity in some cases, certainly have as deep philosophies and spiritualities and as wonderful aesthetic expressions. So you sort of become half Chinese, sort of become half Japanese, like my friend Father Johnston. He's an Irish Jesuit, but he's lived most of his life in Japan. He's de facto half Japanese culturally. Or other Jesuit friends I have that live in India and they look just like Hindus. They wear kurta, pajamas, they dress, they talk, they look, they act like Indians. So after a few centuries of that, those Jesuits out there in the field have a respect and a knowledge for the local traditions that their buddies back in Rome don't at all. And they've been in dialogue with the meditators, the Buddhist meditators, the Hindu yogis, etc. So what has happened now is that it's exactly the Jesuits who have reintroduced the whole meditation technology back. Well, anyway, I didn't mean to get into a whole digression on the history of Western religion, but I don't know. It's interesting to me. I hope it's interesting to you or you see some relevance to what we're doing here. Because I don't know, maybe some of you trip out that we're in such an old-fashioned Catholic place. I like it. I totally relate to it. Actually, my own teacher, Joshu Sasaki Roshi, used to quite regularly hold Zen retreats at where Father Keating used to be. I can't remember exactly, but it was a big, what do they call that, Trappist monastery. And he'd go in and he'd put on the Trappist robes and he'd make up Christian koans for the monks, like tailor-made for their purposes. I think you all probably know what a koan is. If you don't, it's like one of those questions like, what's the sound of one hand clapping or what's your original face or move or things. So he would make up for the Christians. The first koan he gave the monks there was, what is your experience of God when you make the sign of the cross? Manifest for me your experience of God when you make the sign of the cross. That was the first koan that they had to pass. So he created a whole Christian Zen for them. And then he would also, he would describe Buddhism in terms of Christianity. He would say that, or he would ask some questions like, what was Jesus's experience of God when he was on the cross? Stuff like that. And this is in a Zen interview. But basically, he would say, he would give Buddhist talks, but he would use, he would say that what Buddhism is about, Buddhism recognizes resurrection. Resurrection is the heart, you use these Christian terms, resurrection is the heart of Buddhism. Unless you understand about resurrection, you cannot understand what Buddhism is about. And then he would say things like, dying is the easy part. The resurrection is the hard part. Even though dying is not that easy, relative to resurrection, it's hard. And any religion that doesn't teach resurrection is a false religion. And he talked like this. And he was talking about his own experience. That's why he would say it was such conviction. Do you understand what he meant when he said resurrection is the heart of Buddhism? Well, it goes back that experience of no self and full self. Allowing the self to dissolve is half of the enlightenment experience. Allowing the self to reform without interference. Well, that's resurrection, isn't it? So, he would talk in those kinds of terms. I find that it's utterly fascinating how things, how they change historically and the interactions that take place, things that you would never expect if you look at past history. So now you've got these Jesuits all over the place that are teaching Buddhist-type sitting and yoga workshops and all that sort of stuff. So anyway, I think it's just utterly fascinating. But he's got a quote in here. I just happened to pick up the book. And he has a quote that is like, it's from Thomas Merton. Some of you have probably heard of him. Well, I think you'll see the relevance of it. I just picked this book up and first of all I saw the in-scape and that tripped me out. And then I just opened it up and it was like a very interesting description. So I saw this yesterday and I wanted to share it with you. Thomas Merton has well described the paradox of emptiness and filling of death and new life. And then here comes the quote from Merton. All the paradoxes about the contemplative way are reduced to this one. Being without desire means being led by a desire so great that it is incomprehensible. It's too huge to be completely felt. It's a blind desire, it seems like a desire for nothing, only because nothing can content it. And because it is able to rest in no thing, then it rests, relatively speaking, in emptiness. But not in emptiness as such, emptiness for its own sake. Actually, there's no such entity as pure emptiness. And the merely negative emptiness of the false contemplative is a thing, not a nothing. It's very true. In other words, the negative emptiness, the empty in the sense of your bank account is empty. That's not the emptiness that the meditator is talking about. That's actually a thing. That's not no thing. That's a thing called, oh my God, no money in my bank account. True emptiness is that which transcends all things and yet is imminent in all. Expansion and contraction surrounds all things and is in the inside of all things also. For what seems to be emptiness in this case is pure being, completeness in other words. But it's not this or that. Whatever you say of it, it is other than what you say. The character of emptiness, at least for a Christian contemplative, is pure love, pure freedom. Love that is free of everything, not determined by anything or held down by any special relationship. It's love for love's sake. It's a sharing through the Holy Spirit in the infinite charity of God. And so when Jesus told his disciples to love, he told them to love as universally as the father who sends rain alike on the just and the unjust. Be perfect as your heavenly father. This purity, freedom, and indeterminantness of love is the very essence of Christianity. It is to this above all that monastic prayer aspires. Okay. So now do you feel more comfortable in a Catholic church? Question from the audience. They don't, but some of them do. The question is, were you looking at Dharma? Okay. The question is, in Sanskrit and Pali, why are all the D's followed by H's? And they're not. So, for example, well, okay. I'm tempted here to go on another discourse on comparative Indo-European philology, which is absolutely fascinating. Now, I get to have fun too. Okay. Da, ga. I didn't quite see it. It's a little hard to see it. Da, ga. Can you see it move? Da. Okay. I'm blowing out breath. This is too thick a piece of paper to actually demonstrate it, unfortunately. Da. Yeah, there you can see. Da. Da. Okay. Ga. Ga. Ba. Ba. Okay. Now, pa, pa. Ta, ta. Ka, ka. See the difference? The only difference is there's no difference in place of articulation or voicing. The only difference is the amount of air that's blown out. And if you blow out a little extra air when you make a stop sound like a P, a T, or a K, or a D, G, or B, then it's referred to as being aspirated, to aspire, is to breathe on something or to blow on it. Some languages distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated sounds. English is not one of those languages. When we put in an H, an H in our usage has various effects, but not aspiration. When you write TH, that changes it from a stop to what's called a fricative. It goes from being a ta to a tha. But in some languages that distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants, when that's written in a Roman or English script, it's indicated by an H. So there's a B in Sanskrit and Pali, and then there's an aspirated B, which is written a BH, and that's pronounced ba. Ba versus ba. Da versus ga. Da versus da. And there's also ta versus ta. So that just indicates, those are completely different sounds to the Indian ear. They're totally different. But to an English speaking ear, they both just sound like versions of D. In Sanskrit, you have PTK, then you have PH, TH, KH, then you have BDG, then you have BH, DH, DH. So it's perfectly parallel like that. So in any event, that's what that's about. So you don't have to try to emulate that pronunciation, but it's pronounced dharma. But the dhana is just a plain D like in English. Let's see, that's a DH. BH would be like bhavana, B-H-A-V-A-N-A, which means meditation. Sangha, perfect. Perfect example. S-A-N-G-H-A. Sangha. Greek had aspirated sounds, but we now write them TH, PH, and CH. Yes? Did the Greeks have a word for impermanence? The impermanence was not a big concept in Christian Greek of the Middle Ages, but the earliest of all Greek philosophers, Periclitus said pantahre, that's another aspirated sound. Pantahre, which means everything flows. So I think that some of them had some concept of impermanence. Yes? I have another language question. When you were talking about hesed, I thought you were going to say it was related to the word for mercy, the biblical dharma of this Greek. No, it's not. Not at all. It has absolutely no connection other than it happens to sound remotely similar. There's a word in Hebrew hesed, which would be written C-H-E-S-E-D or H-E-S-E-D. It's actually chet samech talet when you write it in the Hebrew letters. That's an interesting word. Hesed means love in Hebrew. And a chesid is a lover, someone that's in love with God or shares the sentiment, the loving sentiment towards God. And chesidut or hesedism is the pietistic tradition within Judaism, which also often involved a lot of meditation. In our sense, our meaning Buddhist sense of meditation. I'm sure you've all heard of Hasidic Judaism. You've probably all seen Hasidic Orthodox Jews. That's from the word hesed. But what's interesting is in contrast to hesed, there is another word, which is gvura, which would be G-E-V-U-R-A-H, I guess if you wrote it in English. But it's gimo, beit, avav, reish, alef. God is said according to the meditative tradition in Judaism. If you want to understand God, you have to understand two sides of God. One is called hesed and the other is called gvura. And the entire creative power of God rests in these two attributes and the interrelationship of these two attributes. And some of you may know the meditative tradition within Judaism is under two categories. One is called Hasidism and the other is called Kabbalah. And these two often went hand in hand. Hesed is the affirming side of God, the side that allows, that gives. And gvura is the negating side of God, the side that pulls in, that limits. Does it sound familiar? Expansion, contraction. And the job of the Jewish mystic was yes, to unite with God, which is called dvekut, but even more than that, to understand how God creates continuously, continuous creation. And apropos of the quote from Thomas Merton about emptiness, the essence of the entire Jewish mystical tradition is contained within one phrase in Hebrew, which is bria yeish me'ayim. Bria is the same words that are in the, it's the second word in the Bible, okay? Breshit bara elohim, okay? It says in the beginning God created. Creation, yeish of things, existences, things, stuff. Me'ayim, from ayin. Ayin is the Hebrew verb meaning nonexistence or nothing. So the entire endeavor was to contemplate how moment by moment emptiness produces somethingness. It's the heart sutra, okay? Form is emptiness, emptiness is, it's like exactly that. And believe me, the people that formulated Hasidism and Kabbalah never heard of Buddhism. They never heard of Buddhist concepts of emptiness as being the source of somethingness. Yet they come up with these remarkable phrases. And the way that you are able to contemplate that, how you become the kind of person that can experience time, space, self, and world, creation, arising, formed by this very rich nothingness, the way that you experience that is by retracing the steps of creation and going back to the primordial vibration of expansion and contraction, okay? I mean, it's just amazing. And when you do that, your sense of self as a thing dissolves. And you know that Jewish way of praying where you're like, you daven, it's called davening, there's another word though that they use for it. I forgot, another Yiddish word. But anyway, the reason that you move like that is that you're supposed to be emulating what a flame does in the wind, okay? A flame has no self. It has no yesh, no fixated existence. It just blows in the wind. And of course, you may or may not know, but the word spirit in English is a translation of the Latin spiritus, which is a translation of the Greek pneuma, which is a translation of the Hebrew ruach, which means wind. So that's the word for impermanence, okay? You are supposed to be like a flame without any fixated somethingness inside of you. And in Hebrew, the whole process of seeing beyond the ego identification that you've heard me say over and over again, mysticism is breaking the limited identity of the small self. In Buddhism, that's called the experience of no self. And there's this word in Hebrew, it's really just a phrase rather in Hebrew, which is bitul hayesh. And bitul hayesh means the annihilation of somethingness, which is this sort of letting go of the small self, letting go of the ego, letting yourself be expanded and contracted until you disappear. And they call it the annihilation of somethingness. And by the bitul hayesh, the process of annihilating somethingness, you can come to a realization of briah yesh me'ayin, how somethingness comes out of nothingness. So that's Sasaki Roshi's statement about any religion that doesn't teach resurrection is a false religion, but what he's talking about is not believing in somebody else's resurrection, but literally experiencing your own resurrection moment by moment. I don't know why I got off on this tangent. You obviously now realize I do not prepare my talks. For better or worse, it's whatever stray thoughts flowing through my mind. So I just happened to see this book and it got me on this whole tangent. Western analogs to the work that we're doing. But I think it's useful to know if nothing else, if somebody comes up to you and says, this is against Christianity or Judaism, you have some ammunition intellectually to counter that. Yeah. I'm curious if you've read much about the Gnostic Gospels and if there's in those early texts that have been discovered any of our kind of Buddhist contemplative stuff? That I don't know too much about. Of course, the one thing I can tell you, perhaps is a trivial fact, but it is interesting. The word gnosis, which is written G-N-O-S-I-S, and was pronounced gnosis by the Greeks, that root, the G-N-O root, is the same as the J-N-A root in Sanskrit, as in prajna. The O sounds in Greek became A sounds in Sanskrit. So knowing that, you can immediately see that the Sanskrit word prajna, which is a knowing forth, corresponds exactly historically to the Greek word prognosis. So the gnosis of gnosis is linguistically related to the J-N-A of prajna. Because the J-N-A was a, well, I won't explain why that happened. I'll also say, by the way, that it's related to the K-N-O of the English word K-N-O-W. The text would prove that Christ really did this kind of practice? Well, whether Jesus did this kind of practice, that's highly debatable. That I'm not sure of at all. I mean, yes, he probably did something because he would go off by himself and do retreats. So I mean, what's he doing in the desert? He's doing some sort of very special prayer or meditation. But there are some things that, see, I don't want to get into a whole discourse and we've very much run out of time, but there are certain things in the gospel that are very interesting. You don't have to go to what's called patristic or medieval Christianity. There are things in the earliest Christian literature that are quite interesting from a Buddhist perspective. Not the least of which is the resurrection. Because, I mean, see going into a state where your body temporarily dies, this happens routinely in intense monastic training in Asia. And there's even stories of, oh, the village guru died. The village guru died. Okay, well, we'll have a big funeral. They got him on the pyre, right, and they're about to light it and he gets up and he says, you idiots, I was just in formless samadhi. Okay, you almost destroyed my body. Now that kind of thing is daily fare in village India. In Europe, it's like supernatural. But there's things in the actual, I don't know about the Gnostic gospels, but the standard synoptic gospels that are accepted in Christianity. There's things like if thine eye be single, then thy whole mind will be light. Isn't there some quote like that? Body will be full of light, something like that. That sounds like samadhi to me. Well, anyway, I better cut off before I get into more trouble.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.44, "text": " I really got tripped out by the thought when I went down to the dining hall of, wow, isn't", "tokens": [286, 534, 658, 1376, 3320, 484, 538, 264, 1194, 562, 286, 1437, 760, 281, 264, 17874, 6500, 295, 11, 6076, 11, 1943, 380], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4089027260834316, "compression_ratio": 1.289655172413793, "no_speech_prob": 0.015864860266447067}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 11.44, "end": 24.04, "text": " this neat?
