{"text": " I'd like to talk a little bit about a very useful technique in the vipassana tradition, which is called labeling. As I mentioned, the basic principle in vipassana is to train, to be able to maintain specific awareness with respect to the components of one's experience, moment by moment. Like the proverbial pie, our experience can be cut up a lot of different ways, and you can cut it into six pieces, but then each one of those pieces can be cut into sub-pieces, and the pieces, sub-pieces can be more finely cut, because there are components, sub-components, sub-sub-components in every experience. For example, if a person is having what in the English language is referred to as an emotion, a negative emotion, let's say like fear or anger or irritation, that experience has basically two components. One is that there are ideas, a sequence of ideas erupt in the mind, and at the same time a sequence of sensations erupt in the body. So the first level of cutting that experience or being aware of components would be to be able to keep track what part of the experience is ideas, what part of the experience is body sensations. So that would be keeping track of the components. But if you take a particular component, for example the body sensations, those body sensations will be welling up in different parts of the body. So to be aware of the locations as they change moment by moment would be to be aware of sub-components of that experience. The body sensation is made up of a welling up in the knee and then a welling up in the chest and then a welling up over the whole body and then maybe a welling up that goes to three or four places and then a welling up that goes into the face, for example. So to know at any given moment the body sensation involves face, chest, knee, whole body, is to know the sub-components. To be aware that each welling up itself involves smaller fluctuations, each wave is made of sub-waves, etc. To be able to trace that would be to know the sub-sub-components. Likewise with the thought, to be able to be distinctly aware of each burst of thoughts, to know if thought is a component, then each burst is a sub-component and each burst itself may speed up or slow down, may accelerate or decelerate. To know those rates of acceleration and deceleration would be to know the sub-sub-components. Having any motion is a rather large piece of experience. We can take a small piece of experience, let's say the act of walking. To know the right foot is moving or the left foot is moving is to know the components. To be aware of the lift, swing, and placing down of the right and left foot is to know the sub-components. To be aware of the sequence of little jerks that constitute the lifting, the sequence of little jerks and pulls that constitute the pushing forward of the foot, the sequence of little jerks and pulls that constitutes the placing, the sequence of impacts of the floor as it touches in different places, that is to know the sub-sub-components of the act of walking. As we're sitting here in this room, components of our experience are hearing, seeing, feeling in the body, and thinking. To know each time the eye shifts, however slightly, is to know the sub-components of the seeing. To be able to detect the impact of sound as it wells up and subsides, to experience it as changing levels, is to know the sub-component of the hearing component. If a person were able to know the components, sub-components and sub-sub-components of the entire experience of sitting here, well, we would say that that person's meditation had covered the entire experience, and that would be indeed awesome. But yet, with practice, a person can expect to be able to do this. So when I say be aware, it doesn't necessarily mean be thinking about. It means be able to detect or have contact with or have sensitivity to. In order to develop this kind of precision or clarity or specificity of awareness, there are various techniques that have been developed within the Vipassana tradition, and one of them is labeling. When you do labeling, you take some experience and you mentally or vocally label the components. For example, if the experience is walking, you could label right, left, or you could label lifting, swinging, placing. If the experience is breathing, each time you breathe out and you feel your abdomen or you feel the breath at your nose, you could say to yourself, out. Each time you breathe in, you could say in, or you could say rising, falling, as you feel the abdomen rise and fall. If you're having an emotion, each time you're aware that the body is erupting, you could say feeling. Each time you're aware that you had an idea, you could say to yourself, thinking. You'd be labeling the components of the experience. Of course, the Vipassana awareness is not just components. It's to be aware of components, subcomponents, sub-subcomponents. So the labels are only done with respect to the really gross, large pieces of the pie, so to speak. It's completely impractical. Indeed, it's impossible to make a description with labels of all the fine detail, all the subcomponents and sub-subcomponents that you will be detecting. Your awareness will be very fine, very detailed, detect a lot. But the label, the mental or the internally spoken or externally spoken word that describes the component of experience, that is very simple and only deals with the large-scale stuff. So as you say lifting and you lift your foot, you've just labeled the component lifting, but your awareness should be able to detect many, many little movements involved with that lift. But you don't try to label those. You don't try to say, you know, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, or pulling, pulling, pulling. It's happening too quickly. Many things are happening simultaneously. Many of the subtler things cannot be put into words. If you try to label too much detail, you'll become frenetic. And definitely the purpose of the labeling is not to become frenetic. In other words, if you find yourself feeling like a juggler that has too many balls and you're sort of, you know, running to catch them, that means you're trying to label too much detail and cut down on the detail and just label larger or more stately or slower aspects. I would say in general a person makes a label every second or two or three or four seconds, something like that. If 10-15 seconds pass and you haven't labeled something, then you're spacing out. Okay? But if you find yourself going something like right, left, knee, you know, just like sort of out of breath trying to label all this stuff, then you're labeling too quickly. So you'll find that there's a sort of pace there. As I say, it's desirable that the awareness detect as much detail and as much quick material and subtle material as possible. But the actual mental or spoken labels are just really big pieces. If you think of the difference between the amount of information you get when you look at a picture versus the amount of information you get when you look at the label of the picture, okay, you look at the picture, there's an enormous amount of detail. The label is just something very, very simple. And the same labels, landscape, still life, can refer to very different pictures. So you might be noting where the sensation arises and you say knee, knee, knee. But each time you said knee, there's a different shape, a different quality, a different intensity of sensation in the knee. But you just simply label knee. By and large, the labels, the simpler the better. Because the purpose of the labeling is not to describe what's going on. The purpose of the labeling is to point your awareness to what's going on and to remind you to bring yourself back. The other purpose of the labeling is because it's done in a very gentle and matter-of-fact voice, whether it's spoken internally or externally. It's done, if I were to label body locations of my sensations, face, chest, hands, very impersonal, very gentle, very matter-of-fact. So that labeling reminds you to be gentle and open and matter-of-fact with the sensation or whatever phenomenon it is that you're labeling. So the labeling does two things. It reminds you to focus your awareness and really soak in to the thing that you're labeling. So really have a moment of great clarity with that. And it reminds you to relax into that experience. Some people don't like labeling. If you don't like it, don't do it. It's as simple as that. Just be aware of the components and sub-sub components. The reason people don't like it is severalfold. One of the reasons people don't like it is legitimate. Another reason that people don't like it is not legitimate. The legitimate reason why people may not want to make those labels is it stimulates the thinking process. Some people find that it's too agitating. They're trying to get calm and it militates against that. Although I would say that what does happen with experience is that after a while you're just making the labels and they don't stimulate the thinking. The labels themselves, believe me, are not an agitation to the mind. The agitation of the mind is the turning, the churning of the mind. And once you develop a skill at labeling, it doesn't agitate or make the mind churn. But at the beginnings, because people are sort of trying to make those labels, it sometimes does agitate their mind in general. Some vipassana teachers force you to keep on labeling despite that fact. And what you discover is after a while the mind is not agitated by the act of labeling. But other vipassana teachers say, well, if a person doesn't like doing it because it agitates their mind, then why require that they do it since it's after all just a stratagem, it's just a crutch to develop the mindfulness. If you can have the mindfulness without the labels, then well and good. But there's another reason why people don't do the labeling, which is not legitimate. And that is it's hard work. It's much easier to sit there and be spacey than to force yourself to describe what's going on, either mentally or vocally. And that's no excuse for not doing it, okay? Because it's like if you don't lift heavy weights, if there's not some challenge, then the muscles will never develop. And there is a certain aspect of work involved. Of course, you don't want to lift weights that are too heavy, because you could pull a muscle. Labeling can be done either mentally or vocally. For vocal labeling, you can go outside, you can go to your room, because obviously you don't want to be the only one in the room talking while everybody else is in silence, unless you want to observe the sensations that go with the intense self-consciousness of knowing that everybody thinks that you're an SOB, okay? Which could in and of itself be a deeply enlightening meditation. If you were really doing that, I wouldn't mind if you labeled in the room, okay? But it's pretty hard to do that. As I say, the advantage of having our own private rooms, well, on a retreat we call them meditation cells, not rooms, okay? That's the old word from the Middle Ages. The monks, you know, they are in their cells. So you have your own private cells for meditation, is you can go and do the vocal labeling. People resist the mental labeling, they resist the vocal labeling even more. Then don't come to me and complain that your mind is wandering, okay? Or that you're having difficulty concentrating, because the first thing I'm going to ask you is, have you tried going to your room and vocal labeling? Because when we get caught up in our own thinking process, which of course is the most common bete noire, the monster that bothers people at the beginning of their meditation, it means we're yanked into a kind of valley of subjectivity. Vocally labeling, saying the words out loud in a crisp, clear way, is a very objective biofeedback procedure. It's feedback on what's going on inside of you. And you can't be grossly spaced out and be listening for your own voice every second or two seconds. You can't be spaced out for more than a second or two if you're listening to your own voice. If you're mentally labeling, it's a little easier to space out. If you don't label and try to do it with direct awareness, that's the most peaceful, but that is also the one that is the easiest to get spaced out with. So you can make choices whether you want to have just direct mindfulness or use mental labels to prompt your mindfulness or use vocal labeling. You can think of it as gears of a car. If you're going up a hill, go into first gear. Go to your meditation cell and vocally label. If you're on the highway and there's no traffic, cruise control. You can just be with direct awareness and you don't even have to mentally label. Labeling is a very generic technique. You can take any aspect of experience, determine its major components, and label them. And as I say, each time you make the label, you're aware of that component, but you try to be aware of the subcomponents and sub-subcomponents that constitute the thing you're labeling while you make the label. A given phenomenon can be labeled in various ways. As I say, the pie can be cut up in a lot of different ways. I can think of at least three different ways, three different categories that a person could label with respect to the feeling, which is the body sensations. I'm just going to say this to show you the generic nature of labeling. I don't want to say this to confuse you, okay, because then you'll say, well, there's so many different techniques. But one could label intensity levels, okay? Stronger, weaker, strongest, like that. One could label locations, face, chest, arms, like that. Or one could label flavors, touch of clothes, sleepiness, pressure, posture. These are the different types of sensations arising, or flavors. That's just with respect to body sensation. With respect to the thinking process, there's a couple of different ways a person could label. You can label the types of thoughts, or you can label when the thoughts begin and when the thoughts end, etc., etc. So it's a very, very broad, very generic procedure. The initial object of meditation that we're going to have in this retreat, insofar as my talks go, and insofar as my guided meditation that I'll give you goes, we'll take as our initial object of meditation, what is called vedana in the Pali language. And vedana is probably best translated into English as feeling. What do I mean by feeling? Hot and cold is feeling. The touch of the clothes is feeling. Sleepiness, the heaviness and the yuckiness that we have in our body when we get sleepy is feeling. The sensation of the blood circulating, the sensations associated with the breath and the abdomen, the chest, at the nose, these are feeling. If you have heaviness in your stomach because of eating too much food, or if you have hunger in your stomach, if you need to go to the bathroom, if you're thirsty, these are all feeling. Illnesses cause feeling. Sexual arousal is feeling. In addition to that, when we have emotions, any emotion, strong, weak, if you remove those parts of the emotion that are thoughts, the moment-by-moment arising of thoughts, if you take that away from the emotion, what you're going to be left with is moment-by-moment pure feeling, because emotion is a tangle of thought and feeling. According to many traditions of Vipassana, feeling is equivalent to body sensation, and if you look carefully, it is indeed, I believe that is the case. When you are having an emotion, if it is possible to let go of the involvement with the thoughts, and you observe carefully, you'll find that all the feelings are indeed body feelings. They have locations within the three-dimensional framework of the body. Of course, if you are preoccupied with the thoughts, you won't have enough awareness to detect the feelings tangibly in the body, because as soon as emotion arises, we're so centered in the thinking part of it, therefore the feeling part becomes nebulous, and we don't realize the feeling is indeed three-dimensional. It's like a multi-colored arabesque of energy that flows through two arms, two legs, a head, and a torso. By multi-colored, I mean there are different qualities to the feeling, different flavors, and it moves as a wave, and the wave has a three-dimensional spatial distribution that constantly changes, but is always inside the contours of the body. So we can identify body sensation with feeling according to this tradition, and that becomes very useful, because then we can work with any and all body sensation as a kind of conduit into the feeling process, and as the awareness of body sensation becomes more and more refined and more high-resolution, then we discover that this volume of the body becomes literally like a screen, and we can see the whole emotional life displayed three-dimensionally and tangibly in real time, and it's just extraordinarily useful to have feeling become tangible in that sense, observable in that sense. You all know the difference between high-resolution computer screen and low-resolution computer screen, or most of you know the difference, or you know the difference between the quality of a photograph as it appears in a newspaper versus the quality of a photograph as it appears in National Geographic magazine. What is the difference? The difference is in National Geographic magazine, the dots are much smaller than in the newspaper, so there's a higher density of information in the picture that you get from National Geographic magazine or Life magazine, as opposed to the more fuzzy quality that you get in a newspaper. One is called high-resolution, one is called low-resolution. Resolution means the ability to distinguish points that are close. If you have lots of little teeny points, you make lots of little teeny distinctions, and everything is very, very sharp and clear. If you have a few big points, then you get this sort of fuzzy, nebulous, low-resolution. Most human beings, the resolution of their body sensations, therefore their ability to be clear and precise about feeling is very, very low resolution. That's the bad news. That's basically what has screwed up our species. We don't know how to be in precise contact with feeling. The good news is, by mere practice, we can raise the resolution of the body so that it goes from being real nebulous to being really, really precise and sharp. And when we do that, we discover that unpleasant feelings don't get in the way, and that pleasant feelings bring much deeper satisfaction. So we can have our cake and eat it too, just by doing one learning. So we'll take as our initial object of meditation in this retreat, just that aspect of experience which is feeling, or equivalently, body sensation. And I'm going to give you one way of labeling the feeling process, which I think is a good way to start, because it's pretty tangible, it's pretty easy to do. And that is to label the place or places where sensation is arising at a given time in the body. Just as a person's eyes will wander through a room just naturally, if you don't fixate your gaze, you'll tend to look here, look there. The center of somatic awareness will tend to move around, and sometimes it goes to more than one place. You be aware of two or three places at once. Sometimes it goes to one place and sort of stays there. Sometimes you get a sense of the whole body as you sit there. So what we're going to let happen is, we're going to let all that happen. We'll let the awareness freely float through the body. And every second, or two seconds, or three seconds, or four seconds, label the place or places where a sensation is coming to prominence. I'll do it out loud for a second with what's really happening with me at this moment. Chest, hands and face, jaw and arms, whole body, both arms, whole body, several, several, little finger. Notice sometimes it went to two places and I use the word and. Sometimes it went to a bunch of places and I just said several. Remember the labels are not important. The awareness is important. If you want to say Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola, Sprite, that would be just as good, as long as that was helping you keep your awareness on, you know, at each transition. Sometimes you notice it covered the whole body. If you find that you are going knee, knee, knee, knee, that's okay, but that might get a little boring after a while. Then what that means is probably that you've got a pain in the knee and it's drawing your attention. Well, within that knee though, you can create a finer spatial grid. Watch how the awareness moves around in the sensation of the knee. Upper right, lower left, middle, overall, overall, like that. It will tend to move around. This is just as the awareness tends to circulate broadly through the body, if the awareness gets fixated in some part of the body, it will still tend to circulate in microscopically in that fixated area. You can actually feel incredible detail of movement of awareness just in the tip of your little finger, if you focus there. So if you find that the awareness naturally fixates on a certain point or a certain spot, fine, let that happen. You can either just label that spot or you can label the smaller movements going on inside that spot. What is not necessary to do is to say anything other than the place. When I have people vocally label in front of me, very often they'll give, initially they'll give a whole monologue, okay, it's like a whole narrative. Well, I think there's something moving down my chest and now it seems to be going into my knee. That is way too complicated. You just say chest, knee, face, like that. Because you don't want to put energy into creating those kinds of detailed descriptions. You want the energy to go into a moment of intense confrontation with the reality of the sensation as it arises. By confrontation I don't mean fighting, I mean being confrontation, being face to face with it. That's what is called satipatthana or the establishing of intense mindfulness moment by moment with what's coming up, like two hands greeting like this, touching, the mindfulness and the phenomenon, touch, touch, touch. That's where the energy should go. I think that that is probably a sufficient description of how to label the locations of the body sensations. Oh, yes, I wanted to say this. Sometimes I have people do this exercise and in an interview they say they don't have any sensations. It's amazing, okay, interesting what people say. And then I'll say, well, can you feel your underpants? Yeah. Can you feel your socks? Yeah. Can you feel your undershirt? Yeah. Can you feel the cushion? Yeah. You sit there for half an hour, your legs hurt? Yeah. Okay. And they say they don't have any sensations. They must somewhere unconsciously think that we're having them look for something special or unusual. Basically, there are three causes of sensation in the body. It can arise from physical impact, the effect of the posture, the room is hot and cold, your clothes are touching you. It can arise from the functioning of the body, your state of health, your state of rest, the foods you've eaten, the pumping of the blood, the muscles working to maintain the posture. The breath itself. All of these cause sensations. And then the operation of the other five senses could cause body sensations. Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and thinking can cause body sensations. So while you've been sitting here, maybe some people were annoyed by the walking upstairs. If you were annoyed, there was subtle, tense, painful, aversive sensations filling your whole body that were evoked by sound. If you're sitting there and having a sexual fantasy, imagining a sexual encounter that's going on in your mind, your body is experiencing in miniature erotic sensations, even orgasmic, but in microscopically in miniature. So that's a thought giving rise to a body sensation. When you eat your food, the taste of the food affect the whole body. The smells affect the whole body. So the other source of sensation in the body is the other five senses. I like to think of, in terms of sources of sensation, that there are three. Physical, physiological, and then from the other senses. Sort of like in reaction to the arising of the other five senses. The hearing, the seeing, the smelling, the tasting, and the thinking. Another aspect of sensation, body sensation, or feeling, vedana, is that it can be either mild or intense. Obviously another aspect is it could be pleasant or unpleasant. With this exercise, we are equally interested in sensation from any cause. So if you don't feel anything, you certainly feel you're closed. And if that's all you feel when you sit there, or you feel your legs start to hurt, if that's all you feel when you sit there, that's what is. It's a physical origin. That's what to attend to. Because we're developing a generic skill with feeling. We're not trying to have certain kinds of feeling. We're trying to develop the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity with respect to feeling. And any feeling is valid material to work with. Like a person that's developing strength by lifting weights, it doesn't matter what color the weights are. The point is to lift the weights. The second thing is, be equally willing to attend to subtle sensations as strong sensation, as you are to strong sensations. When you let the awareness just go where it wants to go, what you'll discover is, it goes to mild sensations just as frequently as it goes to strong sensations. Where you're pulled won't necessarily be intense. It might be rather light. My favorite catchphrase, subtle is significant. Subtle sensations are very important. I'll explain later on. They say love makes the world go round, and in a sense that's definitely true. But in another sense, that's what makes the world go round in terms of ultimate cause, is love. That's for sure. But on the surface, in terms of a more superficial view of human life, it's not love that makes the world go round. It's subtle sensations. Okay? Subtle driver sensations that are so subliminal that people aren't even aware of them, is what is driving and distorting human behavior every day. So if you're pulled to mild sensations or sensations that seem very wispy, pay attention to them. Those are just as significant as strong sensations. And be just as willing to open up to unpleasant sensations as you are to pleasant sensations. This is the aspect of equanimity. If you have not done much meditation before, it's a little bit frightening when you come to these retreats, because you may have some mild physical discomfort. Relative to what you're going to have to go through in this life, believe me, anything that you go through on one of these retreats is very mild. You know, your legs hurt a little bit towards the end of the sit, or you feel sleepy, you know, tired, something like that. Your back aches. Sometimes people also get funny little reactions, like they get dizzy, or they get nauseous for no apparent reason. There are little discomforts that come up. But in this environment, one can begin to get insight. The insight that when you don't judge those discomforts in the mind, and when you relax into those discomforts with your body, those discomforts don't bother you so much. They pass through. They cease to cause suffering. And that's a very important thing to learn, because in daily life you'll be encountering stronger and more significant discomforts, and there won't be a bell every half hour that guarantees that you get respite. So try not to be afraid of the little aches and pains. In fact, really make friends with them if you can, understanding that this is called skill at feeling. And once you've acquired that skill, it's going to be very, very useful in daily life. So this is an idealized situation where you can acquire that skill. In daily life there are many reasons that make it difficult to acquire skill at feeling while those feelings are coming up. Usually the feelings, we have to respond to the situation that's causing the feelings. We don't have a momentum of mindfulness from much sitting. The feelings may be very significant, very intense. So it's real hard to learn in daily life how to be a free person. But in this environment where the feelings are pretty predictable, not so intense, we've got the whole momentum of the work that we're doing. It's an ideal environment to learn things. And of course then that learning is carried out with you. It's taken with you. You don't forget. The discomforts that are going to come up, think of them as vaccination against future suffering. When you get vaccinated, you get a manageable dose of the disease, but your body learns immunity from that. So it's a little bit uncomfortable, but it's a small price to pay for not dying from the disease. So you'll have little bits of suffering in this retreat perhaps, but it's a small price to pay to have immunity from suffering in daily life. So treat pleasant and unpleasant as equally valid. Treat subtle and intense as equally valid. Treat the sensations of physical origin or that come through the functioning of the body or that come through the impact of the other senses, including the sensations that come through thought, that are evoked by thoughts. Treat all of them as equally valid. If you observe carefully, you'll find behind every thought is a feeling. There's always feeling associated with the thinking process. If you're sitting there and planning, it means that the mind is planning in order to avoid the unpleasant sensations that happen in the body when you don't know what you're going to do. The disorientation pain, it's a kind of flavor of pain that comes up in the body. If you're sitting there fantasizing, you may be fantasizing in order to get the pleasant sensations that go with that fantasy. You ever notice yourself doing a grandiose fantasy as you're sitting there? You know what I mean by grandiose fantasy? Like a fantasy where you, this is, usually my fantasies are like this, so I figure a lot of other people it's probably true. You run a fantasy where you come out like really cool, you know, in some ways like, you know, you know what I'm talking about? People are laughing now, so you're having the various, those are sensations in the body. Okay, the reason that we run these fantasies is because they cause pleasant sensations and the body likes those pleasant sensations, so behind the fantasy is a pleasant sensation, etc., etc. If you're judging yourself along with that idea of how wretched you are, will be actual unpleasant sensations in the body, etc. So try to be aware of that and included those kinds of sensations in your object of meditation. Okay, any questions about this as a technique? Please understand labeling is a broad technique. The first object I'm giving you is feeling, body sensation, but later we'll be applying labeling to many other aspects of experience. Yes, the question is if we're used to working with the breath, should we just let go of that and let the awareness go wherever? And the answer is yes. Whenever you sit down, you have a defined object of meditation. It means within that object of meditation, the awareness can go where it wants, but if it wanders outside of that defined object of meditation, you bring it back. If the object of meditation is the physical sensation of breath, which is after all is just a subset of body sensation, then you allow the awareness to go as it wishes within the breath, but if it goes to another part of the body or to a thought, you bring it back. Well, if the defined object of meditation is the body sensations in general, of course breath will be included in that. So if your awareness goes to the breath, that's fine, but you don't try to confine it to the breath. You also are willing that it go anywhere. Yes? Yes, place or places. So it would be something like ankle, knee, chest, just the sort of its geographical location. You don't need to label the kind of sensation or the strength of the sensation. That would probably be very complicated. When you label the place, you want your awareness to soak down into that place for just a second or two, like water pouring down into a sponge. Okay, good. Yes? So if the sensation you're feeling is a movement like the breath, you just kind of feel the, you know, sometimes the sensation is not so much a place, it's a movement within the... You can just say breath. Yeah, that's fine. I found myself experimenting with just doing something visual, which was, and it was in line with your talking about contracting feeling and expanding feeling. I started out because my, like between my shoulder blades was hurting, so I decided I would just really expand that in hopes that it would go away or it would move. So I, it sort of became like a big ellipse and then it would shrink down to a dot and then there'd be another dot and I don't know if I'm, in doing this, if I'm distracting myself from the process. Okay, fine. Actually, this is a good point. Whenever you pay attention to the sensations in the body, usually some mental image also arises about the place in the body, okay, or the shape of the sensation or something. But that is a mental image. It's not the actual feeling that's there. You could make that the object of meditation, but you'd have to know that that was your, you're defining it as such. What you're trying to do is penetrate the actual feeling state. Now, in terms of expanding and contracting, you, it's best not to try to get them to do one or the other, okay. Actually, there's one famous Vipassana teacher that talks about playing games with sensations. He says, Vipassana is not playing games with sensations. So, by the way, you feel your smile spread through the body. It's expanding of its own, right? You don't have to make that happen. It's happening of its own. It's best just to be aware if it's getting bigger or getting smaller. You don't try to make it do something and you definitely don't try to make it go away. Neither do you try to make it stay, but you try to have a neutral attitude as much as possible. There is a goal to the Vipassana practice. The goal is to purify consciousness. When a given sensation comes up, if it's an uncomfortable sensation like a pain, what makes that discomfort a problem is that that pain is being frozen by the impurity of aversion, okay? But the pain is one thing. The aversion is something else. The aversion is a quality of consciousness. The pain is a flavor of sensation. When you're observing the pain, therefore, what you're really observing is the pain and the effect of the aversion on that pain. You're observing both of those when you're observing, quote, pain. In other words, what you're actually observing is you're suffering. When the pain and the resistance come together, you get suffering. So you're not actually observing pain. You're really observing suffering. And as you're observing that and trying as much as you can to mentally not judge it and as much as you can to relax your body into it and just be with it, as you keep doing that consistently, somewhere along the line, the underlying resistance will break up. It might break up in five minutes or for some kind of pain it might take you five months. For some kinds of some kinds it might take you five years, depending on the depth of the level of the resistance that is being evoked. But sooner or later that resistance will break up if you continue to observe with mindfulness and equanimity. When the resistance breaks up completely, then that pain turns into effortless flowing energy. But the resistance, this is a sort of subtle point, but the resistance may be in the process of breaking up, but it hasn't broken up completely, well the pain will still be rather solid. It may not bother you so much, okay, but it's still going to be really solid. But when that level of resistance, resistance breaks up completely, then there's nothing to impede the flow of the pain anymore and it breaks up into effortless expansion and contraction. But the point is that we're not trying to get the pain to go away. We're trying to observe the pain long enough so that the underlying resistance goes away and that can only happen as an act of nature. We can't make that happen. When the underlying resistance goes away, that's a permanent change. Pains come and go, okay, but the purification of consciousness is permanent. So you're not trying to make that sensation assume a certain form. You're trying to perfuse that sensation with continuous mindfulness and equanimity. Somewhere along the line as you're doing that, the underlying resistance will crack. And if it cracks enough, at a deep enough level, the pain itself will become fluid. But you should never have that as the goal because that will just delay that whole process. So you can't sit there and say, I want to sit here until this breaks up or goes away because that will just make it stay and stay and stay and stay. You just sit there. I'll tell you the quickest way to break up pain in your body. That's the good news. I can tell you exactly the fastest way in nature to make that pain go away. You know, the shortest distance between two lines is called a geodesic. In flat space, it's a straight line. On the surface of the earth, it would be along a great circle. But in different kinds of spaces, whatever constitutes the shortest path between two points is called the geodesic of that space. We live in the Euclidean flat space, so usually for us, it's a straight line. Any other path than a straight line is longer. It takes you longer to get there than the straight line. So the good news is I can tell you what the straight line is in the experience space. The quickest way to break up pain in your body. That's the good news. Here's the bad news. The bad news is the quickest way to break up pain in your body is be willing that the pain never go away. Really. To reach that point where you're willing to be there infinitely with it. At that time, that will break up the pain most quickly. So it's like one of God's jokes. Very wry sense of humor, don't you think? It seems to me any specific sensation I experience in the larger field, and when one is working with a label, say for example, label is eyebrow. If I'm using that label and I'm focusing all of my attention just on eyebrow, I potentially lose that larger field. It almost is a constriction rather than just an awareness. If you find that the larger field is what pulls you most naturally, which is then basically it's your whole body, then just keep labeling whole body, whole body, whole body. But if you find that you are pulled at some time towards something that pulls you in, then let that happen and just label and be intensely aware of that. And then go back to that sense of the larger field. Okay, then remember the labels are only an approximation. So you can use the labels for the small parts, but your awareness can still be aware of the larger picture, you might say. And there's nothing wrong with the awareness being confined to small areas, as long as there's mindfulness and equanimity as that's happening. Okay, yes? My teaching has been to stay away from labels because they're falsifications of experience. I think what you're saying is that the label is not supposed to be in any way equal to the experience. Is it useful, I guess what I find useful to think of it as being like a flashlight, to say that I'm pointing to what I'm trying to be aware of? Exactly correct. Think of the label as a flashlight. And you don't, okay there, see it? You can see there. Okay, now you can see there. Now you can see there. That's exactly what it's like. That's actually a good metaphor. I'm going to remember that and use it. It's like shining a flashlight, so everything becomes very bright in that place. It's the brightness that we're trying to develop, not figuring out a description of what's going on. And in fact, even though I describe this, and all vipassana teachers describe vipassana as observing, in fact it's not observing. That's a completely misleading way to describe vipassana. And yet every vipassana teacher does it. Why? Because it's a simple way to describe it, but really we're not observing. What we're doing is we are turning up the brightness of the flashlight. We're actually turning on the brightness in all the different parts of our experience. We're not observing experience. We're increasing, it's like on your TV screen, okay, you know you have different brightness. What we're actually doing is infusing brightness into the six senses. We're not observing the six senses. So your metaphor of a flashlight is quite good actually. I could see the brightness, but I don't see the exclusion of the vision. Yes, I understand. I'll get into it for just a second, and later on I'll get into it in more detail. The reason that the word observing is misleading, and yet we all use it, is that observing implies that there's a meditator over here observing the sensations over here. And actually that's not really what vipassana ends up being. Although at the beginning it is going to be that. At the beginning, just like to build a building, you have to put up a scaffolding, and then you're able to build the building and the scaffolding comes down. In order to learn these techniques you have to create what I call a meditating ego, which is a sense of a self running a meditation procedure. But once you've learned that procedure, you have to let that scaffolding come down. The building that you're building is mindfulness. It's not a mindful person. It is the quality of mindfulness. So at the beginning, whenever something wells up, you make a mental label and you let your awareness soak into that object. When you make that mental label, one of the reasons that some people don't like you to do the label is that reinforces the sense of a self over here observing it over there. At some point you can drop that labeling. And what you're really doing is infusing the qualities of brightness and relaxation into each phenomenon. Well, a time comes when the brightness and relaxation becomes so habitual that you don't need a meditating self in order to run that program. It's just there. Does that make sense that that could happen? Like when you drive the car. When you first learned how to drive the car, you had to think about every single aspect of driving the car. It's not reflective in the sense that it doesn't need to reflect a sense of self. Okay. Right now, do you feel self-conscious a little bit? Yes, right. If you investigate carefully, you'll find that some of that self-consciousness is body sensation. And some of that self-consciousness is ideas. Right now everybody's looking at me and I don't know much about this and they all know a lot about this. And I don't know if the teacher is going to praise me or make me feel like a jerk. Okay. These are ideas. And you have an image of yourself here at this retreat. Those are ideas. And then there are body sensations. So at this time, your sense of self is being brought to you by certain ideas and certain body sensations. Underneath those are subliminal ideas and subliminal body sensations. And underneath those are subconscious ideas and subconscious body sensations. When the brightness and the relaxation starts to perfuse those ideas and those body sensations that right now are giving you that sense of self, then you're really doing vipassana. Then what happens is that you clarify the sense of self. The meditator, the meditating ego, becomes clarified in the two senses of the English word, to reiterate what I said before. It becomes crystal clear what part of it is idea and what part is body sensation. That's the components. And the subcomponents, the welling up and passing of those ideas and body sensations also become clear. And the sub-subcomponents, which are the vibrating atoms of those, that becomes clear. When that becomes clear in the first sense of the English word, then the sense of self becomes clear in the second sense. That which was opaque becomes transparent. That transparent self is in Buddhism called no-self. But it merely means a transparent self, a fluid self. The ideas and body sensations still arise, but there's so much light and so much relaxation there that they don't congeal into a rigid opaque object called a thing. They remain as a fluid and clear activity called personality. Does that make sense? Student 2 It's beginning to, this would be sort of, if that makes sense, an unmediated awareness with pure experience at that point. Yes. Which is all we ever have anyway. Okay? When you take away all the unconsciousness and the congealing, you're left with what was always there. Okay? So when we say observe, it's a misleading term, but we all use it. Okay? But ultimately you're not really observing. Observe means there's the object here and there's the meditator here. Real vipassana is an object arises and it's very, very clear and there's no tension in it. And ideas and body sensations that produce the sense of self arise and they're completely clear and there's no tension in it. Therefore, instead of object over here and observer over here, you have the object rising, passing, rising and passing as an effortless activity. The sense of observer rising, passing, rising, passing as an effortless activity. Those two activities becoming a single activity. Okay. Ego is an ambiguous word that means many things to many people, to many psychotherapists. Ego is a highly desirable quality because it means your ability to cope with the world and to integrate your inner experience. Well, ego in that sense is not gone. Not at all. In fact, ego in that sense gets stronger. Ego in the sense of so-and-so has an ego problem. Okay. Yeah. Ego in that sense is very much diminished. The vocabulary can be devastatingly ambiguous, human vocabulary. But I knew in which sense you meant ego. Now you feel your sense of self arising? I trust you. I'd note that one for a moment. Any other questions about the procedure so that you'll be able to do it? Yeah. Oh, okay. Right. I understand exactly your question. Since you brought it up, it's good to address. The question was, I pay attention to my breath. When I get distracted, I note that fact and I come back to my breath. Should I work that way? The answer is if you want to. But understand that there are actually two ways that labeling is done in the vipassana world. And I don't really think you are going to find this in any book. But if you go to retreats and you see how vipassana is being taught, there are really two very different ways that the labeling strategy is used. And I wouldn't say that one is right or one is wrong, but you shouldn't know the distinction between the ways and do one or the other. And I myself do teach just one of those ways, but not because I think it's the right one. It's just I don't want to confuse people too much. And given the general way that I like to teach vipassana, it works better with my style to do it as one of the ways. But let me tell you what the two ways are. In one way, one defines an object of meditation. Typically it's the breathing. And one is aware of that object of meditation and one may label, like a rising, falling. One may be labeling that object or may not be labeling that object. And then when a distraction arises, like a sound or another body sensation or a thought, the person labels and says thinking or hearing and then they come back intentionally to the breath. Now what they're doing is they're using that label as if to say, oh that was just a sound, now come back to the breath. It's sort of a cue to come back to a smaller object. Okay, that was a thought, but now we've come back to the breath. There's nothing wrong with working that way, but that's not the way that I just described the labeling process. That is another way of using the labeling. And an awful lot of people do it and it's fine. The distinction between that and the way I just described labeling is a subtle one, but I think you'll be able to get it. In the second way of working with labeling, you only label things inside the defined object of meditation, which of course could be as broad as everything. Your defined object of meditation could be the six senses. But when you label, the label is accompanied by an intense moment of concentration on the thing that you label. And you may or may not have a home base that you go to afterwards. The way I teach it, you don't have home base. Your job is to just label whatever comes up. And maybe if there's nothing coming up, you'll just naturally be drawn back to your breath. Well fine, but you're not making an intention to go there. That's the way I'm teaching it. So that you don't label unless you penetrate. Penetrate means that you get the awareness to soak into the thing you're labeling. So you don't casually say thought and then come back to breath. In the second way of working, if you say thought, your awareness skewers thought for a second or two. And it's just totally present. There's that establishment of mindfulness face to face with that intensely for the point that you label. And then you wait for the next phenomenon to come up and you penetrate that phenomenon with awareness as you label it. So that's a very different way of using labeling. In one, you are labeling primarily to just sort of remind yourself to come back to something. In the other, you are labeling to remind yourself to penetrate the thing you're labeling. In the first one, you're labeling to remind yourself to ignore the thing you're labeling and come back to some other object. Those are two very different ways of using labeling. And depending on whose retreat you're at, you'll be taught one or the other. But at least know that they're different. And not that one is good or one is bad. Personally, I like to do the latter. I like the idea that if you label, you penetrate. And if your defined object of meditation is the body sensations and you're getting distracted into thoughts, typically I would not tell people to say thinking. I would just tell them come right back to the body and start labeling again inside the body. If you want to label thinking, fine. But then define it as within the object of meditation and try to really let your awareness soak in and have tremendous clarity for a moment with respect to the thought as it's coming up. Does that make sense? Each time you sit down and do vipassana, you have a defined object of meditation. And that can be as narrow as the breath or as broad as all six senses. But you stay within that object of meditation during that sit, during that sitting. You typically do not change unless there is a very compelling reason to change. What would be a compelling reason? Your defined object of meditation is the breath and they start working with jackhammers across the street. And the sounds and the body sensations are so overwhelming you can't even detect your breath. Okay, then you make an intentional change. You say to yourself, in words to yourself, now I am shifting my object of meditation for this reason. So it's crystal clear. And now you have a new defined object of meditation. So I'm not saying that vipassana should be limited to body sensations. But the way I like to teach it is I like to take each aspect of experience, work with it individually, and then put it all together in one big package and work with all the senses at once. That's why I'm teaching you this now. I was wondering if this was part of the whole or whether this is a separate technique. It depends on what vipassana teacher you go to. If you were to study with the great enlightened master Buddhadasa in Thailand, he'd have you work 20 years just on the breath, penetrating more and more deeply and you'd go the entire path of liberation just with that one tiny aspect of experience, the breath. If you study in the Upakin Goenka tradition, they will give you, they'll start you out with the breath but then they'll broaden it very quickly to all body sensations. But they'll never go any broader than that. If you study with Upandita and the Mahasi lineage, the first day you sit down you'll be given the instruction, note every phenomenon that comes up. Okay, and that's it. It's like a one sentence instruction and then that will carry you for the rest of your life. But you have to work with all six senses at once. So it's going to depend on the teacher. And it's interesting, since so many vipassana teachers start you out with the breath and some keep you there for a long time. Some people that don't know much about vipassana think vipassana equals meditation on the breath. Personally, I would discourage you from limiting your object of meditation to being the breath. I know there's a lot of people that think, well I can't even stay focused on my breath, so maybe I better just work on that and not try these other things. But breath for me is primarily a developing of calm and concentration. For insight and purification I feel a somewhat larger object is usually more useful, like the body sensations or the thinking process or both. Shelly once had a really interesting experience. A group hired her, which was not a Buddhist group. They hired her to teach vipassana. They found, oh, you're a vipassana teacher. And after several classes they came to her and they were really upset. And they said, what are you trying to influence our students and playing games with trying to do weird things? We hired you to teach vipassana. We hired you to teach people to focus on their breath. What's all this stuff about watching their body sensations and their thoughts and all that? They had a completely different idea. For some reason they thought they were hiring her as a breath teacher. And she started to have them watch the impermanence of sensations and see that there's no self and everything. And they were a Hindu group and they were all freaked out. OK, any other questions? You make the defined object of your meditation your thoughts. You shine the flashlight not on the content of the thought, but what? Actually, again, I don't want to confuse people by giving you so many options. I'm going to just teach a certain way in this retreat. But some vipassana teachers, in fact, have you note the content. But in a simple way. Obviously, if you try to get too detailed with content, you get into journal writing. And you're not going to try a journal writing there. They would have you note whether it's typically it's most thoughts are either remembering, judging, planning, fantasizing, being confused, believing, wanting, things like that. Is making thought the object, is it useful in keeping yourself from getting carried away in it? It is. By the way, that would be noting the content of thought. That's not the way personally I like to observe thought, though. The answer to your question, if you don't note content, what do you note? Contour. How the thought gets more intense or less intense, how it speeds up or slows down. That's the contour of the thinking process. And that's what I'm going to be teaching you to note by and by. Does that make sense? Yeah. Like the contour is the changing wave form of it. So if you find your thoughts getting in the way of meditating, like you're just getting lost in them. You've got two possibilities. One is to yank yourself away from that each time it happens and bring your awareness back to the object. And that will eventually weaken the gravitational pull of the thinking. That's one option. A second option, if you know how, is to make the thought itself the object of meditation. And that will gradually clarify the thinking process. So if you yank yourself back, that will weaken the pull of the thoughts. If you observe the thinking process, it will make the thoughts transparent so that they're not in the way anymore. So that was a good question. Anything else specifically about the technique that I just gave you? Yes. You've covered this, but would you remind me if your meditation is on bodily sensations, and you suddenly experience a strong emotion, a flash of claustrophobia, I've got to get out of here. Then do you go and look where in the body that is taking place? Absolutely. If your defined object of meditation is body sensation and an emotion comes up, which is likely to happen, then you bring the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity to the body sensations that constitute the feeling half of that emotion. And you ignore the thinking half, if your defined object of meditation is body sensation. Of course, you could more broadly define your object of meditation to include also observing the feeling, the thinking half of the emotion. But it's much harder to observe thinking than it is to observe feeling. And it's much harder to observe the two at the same time than it is to observe either one individually. So no wonder human beings get so caught in their emotions. Of course, I just used the word observe again, didn't I? Okay, any other questions specifically about this procedure? It's pretty clear.
