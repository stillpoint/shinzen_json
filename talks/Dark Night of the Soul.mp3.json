{"text": " Today I'd like to speak on the topic of the dark night of the soul. Many of you are familiar with my style of talking. There are some of you that are here for the first time. So I'd like to tell you that I like to ask questions. I receive questions, but I also like to ask them. So I'll start out with a question. Who coined the phrase, dark night of the soul? Have any of you ever heard this? How many of you, first of all, have ever heard this expression? Okay, oh, that's quite a few. What is the name of the person that started this phrase? St. John of the Cross. And who was St. John of the Cross? A little biographical information will suffice. Huh? He was a Christian mystic. When did he live? I ask questions. Well, it was about the 16th century. He lived in Spain. Actually, his name in Spanish is Juan de la Cruz. And he is associated with another very famous Spanish woman saint. What is her name? Teresa of Avila. That's correct. There have been a lot of Teresas in the history of the Catholic Church. Teresa of Calcutta is just the recent one. This is Teresa of Avila. They were meditators, mystics, in the Carmelite order, which is one of the most ancient orders in Christianity. If you have studied Spanish literature, Juan de la St. John of the Cross is considered to be one of the great early prose writers. And I'm sorry, poets. And St. Teresa was a prose writer, an essayist. So they have their figures in literary history of Europe as well as the spiritual history. They practiced the path of contemplation, which in many ways has similarities to our Buddhist path of meditation. For example, what we call in Buddhism samadhi, states of great concentration. In those days in Christianity, do you know what they called it? They had various words actually. Or they called it the prayer of quiet. That's a nice name for it. We usually think of prayer nowadays as like some sort of dialogue, talking in words and images with God in the Christian tradition. But actually in the ancient days, they recognized another kind of prayer, which was the stilling of the mind. This is something, of course, those of you that are familiar with Eastern discipline know very well. We call it by various names also. Samadhi is a very common name that we use. We call it oratio quius in Latin, the prayer of quiet, the calming of the mind. They also had another name for it, interesting name. They called it recollection. In modern English, if we say to recollect, it means to remember. But think about what the word actually means in the Latin. What would to recollect mean? What does re mean? Back. So to collect back. In other words, to become focused and concentrated. So that was another word that they used. So people like St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross and many, many other Christian mystics, contemplatives, practiced techniques and approaches that in many ways are similar, I feel, to the Eastern disciplines. St. John coined this phrase, noche oscura del alma, dark night of the soul, to describe a certain phase that comes up in the practice of meditation when one practices very seriously. Now, the real dark night of the soul type experience is likely to come fairly far into practice. It's not a beginner's type experience. But even if you meditate a little bit, you may from time to time get sort of a preview or minor versions of what that experience is. I can give you a broad hint about what it's like. If it happens in a non-meditator, it would be called depression. If it happens in a very, very evolved meditator, it's called the dark night of the soul. The reason I want to talk about it today is just in case any of you experience it somewhere along the line. By the way, not every meditator will necessarily have this experience. But if you should have this experience somewhere along the line, or if you encounter another meditator that is having this experience, or if you get some little hint of it in a minor form in your meditation, it will give you a little bit of context. You'll understand what it means and perhaps how to deal with it. So that's one of my goals today. A second goal is that in point of fact the way to deal with it illustrates a very, very fundamental principle in meditation, which is definitely applicable to every single person that meditates. As the result of very deep meditation and deep insight, a person can come to an experience where everything is one, everything is sort of like energy, everything is very peaceful, but also everything is very empty. And the old motivations are seen as largely illusory, the things that motivated you to do this or that. And in one sense life is very peaceful and wonderful and without much fear or things like that necessarily. But in another sense there's a sort of fear that one is losing one's appreciation. Everything's the same. Why do this as opposed to doing that? Why do anything? And one realizes that the spiritual sort of goal that one set up for oneself was largely a projection, a human projection that God isn't really at all like what you thought he, she, it was going to be. And that can be a little disconcerting also. Have any of you ever had little hints of this kind of experience as the result of your meditation? It can happen. One of the reasons it's disconcerting is that one has done all this work, worked through all this stuff to develop one's meditative experience, and then you get to this level and it's like, well, it's sort of hard to get motivated and hard to have appreciation because everything's one. Everything's the same. This is the experience of the dark night of the soul. How do you think that a person could get beyond this experience? I'm of course implying that there is a beyond to this experience. In the Buddhist tradition, by the way, the term that's used for this is falling into the pit of emptiness. Falling into the pit of emptiness. One way that we can look and understand how to get beyond this experience is to look at how we might come to this experience when we do Buddhist meditation. Let's take the tradition that I'm most familiar with, the vipassana tradition. What do we do, those of you that practice it, what do we do in essence when we do vipassana meditation? If you had to describe it in two or three sentences, what's involved? Oh, you have to be ready to answer. Okay. Just sit passively. Awareness. It's an awareness and an observation. And it is an awareness and observation of what? Yes, our own body and mind process. Which would seem to be innocent enough. Okay. Who can fault it? Well, you're just watching what is. You're watching your ordinary mind-body processes with extraordinary awareness. That's all. You're also watching it with a perspective of what we might call non-interference. That is to say, for the times of formal practice, you watch in a very matter-of-fact way. So you're just being aware of, in a sort of mechanical matter-of-fact way, the position of the body, the types of sensation in the body, flow of thoughts, things like that. As the result of doing this, all sorts of changes can take place within the mind and body. Some can be pleasant, some of them can be unpleasant. What are some of the pleasant type things that may come up as you're sitting there just doing this observation? Anybody ever had any pleasant experiences in meditation? What are they like? Very blissful sensations filling one's body. What other types of things? Very calm. Anybody ever have like a bright light or even diffuse light that's sort of pleasant? You can be there. It can also happen that you can get interesting tastes and smells. I don't know if any of you ever had that, or interesting sounds can start to be produced inside of you. One can have pleasant experiences that just sort of happen. Anybody ever have any exaggerated unpleasant experiences while they were meditating? Oh, I think so. You might be sitting here and everything's all calm and everything, and all of a sudden somebody honks their horn and it feels like it's just a knife being stuck into your bowels and twisted, right? Just enormously exaggerated discomfort. Anybody ever have the experience of sitting down and not having anything in the environment particularly happening, but all of a sudden you're crying, okay, or you're frightened, or you're shaking in some way, or it feels like there's ants crawling over you, or bees are stinging you. Anybody ever had experiences like that, or you get very hot or very cold? Or uncontrollable spasmodic tensions moving through the body that don't seem to be caused by any particular thing. No, one can have unpleasant experiences also that just sort of come from nowhere. What do we do with these pleasant and unpleasant experiences when we do vipassana meditation? How do we react to them? Hmm? Right, and watch them change. That is what I would say is the proper answer. In other words, I call that principle what Jean just mentioned, the principle of consistency. That's my word for it. You start out by observing the mind-body process with an understanding that this observation will activate a natural mechanism whereby this mind-body opens up for you. You start out doing that. You're observing in a matter-of-fact way, in a more precise way than you usually would, and you're observing with an awareness of the impermanence of these mind-body phenomena. As the result of this seemingly innocent observation process, very dramatic manifestations may take place. May take place. If those happen, if they should happen, you simply observe those manifestations in a matter-of-fact way, with enhanced precision, and if possible, with the knowledge of their essential, constantly changing nature. In other words, you just do consistently what you started out to do. You don't make any exceptions. No matter how seductively pleasant the phenomena may be, no matter how horribly unpleasant or unexpectedly, shockingly, icky and awful the phenomena may be, you just keep observing with precision in a matter-of-fact way, and if possible, keeping that insider knowledge that this is a changing phenomena. In doing this, you loop back into the process. You know, like in a computer where you loop back, you go around and around. In other words, you recycle these phenomena back into the process. It would seem like a fairly easy principle. Why do I harp away at it? Can anybody tell me? Why do I harp away and repeat it over and over again? Why? Because we'll forget. I'll forget. You'll forget. So it's something that is good to constantly refresh in our memory. If you should ever have this experience, either the full-blown dark night of the soul or little hints of it, what would be one strategy for making it through? What would be a strategy? Just keep observing it. Observe that phenomena. If you start to have thoughts like, oh, I'm going to get a knee injury, I'm going to get a knee injury, I'm going to get a knee injury in the knees, this is horrible, I thought meditation was going to make me feel good, and it's making me feel like nothing matters at all. That's a thought, right? Just watch that thought. Watch it come and go. How many times a day does that happen? If you start feeling like, I don't want to do, I don't want to do, why should I do anything? What's the point of doing things? What kinds of sensations are there? If some fear should arise, sometimes it can happen as part of the dark night of the soul, that you're very calm without any fear at all, but other times fear could arise. What do you do if fear arises? My goodness, everything's empty. Or I'm not here. I'm not really here. I thought I was here, but I'm not. And God's not really here either, not in the way I thought. And fear arises. What would you do with the fear? Observe it. Observe it as body sensation, observe it as the comings and goings of thought. If you start to get afraid because everything is empty, then by definition that fear must also be empty. You don't want to make any exceptions. If everything is empty except your fear of emptiness, you see where the problem arises? To somehow instill the habit of consistency in one's practice from the very beginning, so that you get a certain momentum. This is the name of the game. This is the trick. You want to develop enough momentum in that habit of what I personally call consistency, always looping back into the practice, so that if you should come to that point where there's no you left, or very little you left, very little sense of motivation left, very little sense of goal, everything's all one, the momentum of that habit of observing reactions will still be there to carry you across the void. So it's sort of like an Evel Knievel trip. Remember when Evel Knievel was going to motorcycle across the Grand Canyon or something? It's like you've got to get a huge amount of momentum going, and then when there's no ground under you, that momentum will carry you across that canyon. In this case, the momentum is the habit of consistency in your practice. If you do vipassana, your practice means a matter-of-fact observation of the mind-body process. Anybody doing it right now? I hope so. Otherwise this talk will only mean one-tenth as much as it could. Do it as you hear about it. I try to do it as I speak about it. If our practice is that, which for many of you it is, then whatever comes up is the result of that practice. However sensitized you may become, so that you're picking up just all sorts of stuff that you never picked up before, watch that sensitization in a matter-of-fact way. Oh, today more sensitive, now a little less sensitive. In that way, the goings and comings. You gain a huge amount of momentum in that habit of constantly looping back to your technique. And then when the earth, you suddenly look down and you realize that the earth is not there anymore. All of the things that had started you out on the meditative path are not there anymore. Then there's still a momentum which will carry you across. This would be my personal strategy for making it across the pit of the void. Now I realize I'm talking about an experience that a few of you have had, but most of you haven't had. So this may be a very theoretical kind of thing for many of you. But as I say, it's something to know about. It's because it is something that will happen to many people as they continue with the meditative path over many years in a very serious way. I keep talking about making it over the pit of the void. What's on the other side? What's on the other side of emptiness? What do you think? Somethingness? No, not exactly. Not exactly somethingness. Actually, what's on the other side of emptiness, and I have to say this is based on very limited personal experience, so based on my very limited personal experience, I would say that what's on the other side of emptiness is simply emptiness properly understood. In other words, if you were to take a grapefruit and bite into it, the first taste that you would have, yes, it's the taste of the grapefruit, but it's not really what that grapefruit basically is. The grapefruit, let's say, is basically sweet, but when you encounter the rind first off, it gives you a somewhat erroneous impression of what the fruit inside is. Your first encounter with, quote, the void or emptiness or no-self or impermanence or suffering, whatever word you want to use, these are all aspects of the same experience. Your first encounter with the void may be this sort of negative, static, nothing matters, motivation is difficult, appreciation is difficult type experience. But that's just the little, the thin skin that's on the outside of what emptiness really is. What emptiness properly understood is this enormously dynamic and vital, creative, spontaneous force that cannot help but give rise to appearance instant by instant, instant by instant. Maybe emptiness or nothingness is not the right word for it, but it's the word that all the mystics use. It's like the mystics are their own worst PR people. If you want to get somebody interested in the meditative path, you should use things that are attractive to the average person. Does the average person want something called emptiness, nothingness? I don't think so. Well, why is it that the mystics from all over the world, even though they have no contact with each other, come up with this same vocabulary? It's sort of interesting. In the Kabbalistic tradition of Judaism, which developed quite independently, they talk about Ayan. Ayan means nothing. Ayan is God. They call God nothing. Meister Eckhart was another great Christian mystic, talked about Nix. If any of you know German, what that means, that means nothing. But Judaism talks about Shunyata, emptiness. These people must be talking about something other than a nihilistic experience, what the average person might think of as the word, what nothing or empty, void. On the other side of the pit of the void is emptiness properly understood. Emptiness understood as a vibratory source. So on the other side of emptiness is not just an experience or a realization, but actually becoming that, you might say. You actually become it. You feel it flowing through every muscle of your body when you move. You feel it as the formative flow that is making your thoughts from moment to moment. You might say that if your first experience of emptiness is like putting your toe into the water, when you make it over the pit of the void, you actually go under. Your whole head goes under. But you don't drown spiritually. You in fact experience what's called the great resurrection in the Zen tradition. The great resurrection. It's a whole other way of living, you might say. And at that point, all of the dynamic, appreciative, functional aspects of life that may have become suspended during the dark night, they reappear, but in a spontaneous form. In other words, what's on the other side of the dark night of the soul is living one's life as part of nature again. You just become part of nature. The way that the ripples on the lake are part of nature, the way that the falling of the leaves are part of nature, the way that an avalanche is part of nature. All of these things have a sort of effortless, spontaneous, just-happening quality to them. The price that a person has to pay, it's not really a big one, is that dark night of the soul experience. Don't get me wrong, not everybody has that dark night of the soul experience. I do want to emphasize that. But it can happen, it often happens. And on the other side, as I say, one becomes ordinary again, you might say. One is sort of like the way one was before, except written large. You can imagine, you could write your name small, or you could write it large, and it would still be your name. But the magnitude is completely different. So you become the same person again. You, in fact, at that point, are able to manifest what we might call the fullness of your personality. How do you manifest the fullness of your personality? How does a balloon manifest the fullness of balloon-ness? It gets pumped up, right? Doesn't it? You manifest the fullness of your personality by pumping up your personality, inflating your personality with that very emptiness. I know it's maybe a little hard to understand. This is not a poetic metaphor. This is a linear, matter-of-fact description of what happens. Okay, so this is a little talk for information and encouragement. What to do if you have the experience of the dark night of the soul. Now, after a retreat, it sometimes happens you may feel a little spaced out, a little depersonalized. Anybody ever had that experience? Okay, well then you just wet your little toes into the dark night of the soul. That little feeling of being sort of not quite there and whatever, which is disconcerting to people. I thought I meditated to get more in contact with things. I feel all sort of spaced out and not here. That little feeling is like, you might say, the first indications that the sun is setting for your dark night experience. In other words, it's the beginning of the dissolution of the solidified self. Don't worry, your self never goes away. It just stops being solidified. What should you do if you got that little taste of the dark night of the soul? Like after intense meditation, you sort of go out and you realize that you sort of just have no skin on you and you have no core inside of you. Okay, no place to stand, sort of vulnerable and open and empty. What should you do? Do you remember it? Just observe it with equanimity. At the beginning of the talk, I mentioned that I wanted to bring up this topic, one, for your information, and secondly, to reaffirm this very broad principle in meditation, which is the principle of consistency. No matter what happens, keep on applying your technique. I've come to the end of my wrap as far as this topic goes, so I now have time for a few questions, and I'd be happy to receive them. Beth? How would you differentiate the depression that you described in the lady's dark night of the soul from depressions that have other effects? Well, I would say the following. The dark night of the soul type experience tends to take place in advanced meditators. It takes place as the result of their meditation. Now, I'm not a psychologist, so I don't really know much about the phenomenon of depression in non-meditator type people, but I would say that I think some forms of depression that occur in just your general population are a natural functioning of the mind trying to cleanse itself, and that we mistakenly misinterpret it and call it a problem, you might say. Both the person that is having that experience and the people that may be trying to care for that person may misinterpret it. In other words, if there is a certain pressure in one's deep mind, that pressure will want to relieve itself, and one of the ways it relieves itself is by throwing off sensations into the body. In other words, a lot of the pressure in the deep mind is unresolved feelings from the past, and one way that the deep mind will tend to try to work that pressure off is to bring those sensations to the surface as body sensations. But those sensations may be very subtle. The person will start to feel a certain heaviness in their body, a certain very, very subtle achiness in their body, and that achiness may be very much semi-conscious, but they'll find that they won't feel like doing anything, because it's like to do anything. Anytime you do something, it will cause that ache in the body to get a little stronger. And so they say, well, I don't feel any motivation. I don't feel like I want to do anything. Actually, what it is is that they're sitting around doing nothing because they don't want to feel that somewhat heightened discomfort that would be associated with actually moving and doing. Now, if they were able to actually experience it as a body sensation and open up to the depression as simply a body sensation and move the body with an awareness and an openness to those sensations, I think that they would be helping the mind in this natural process of releasing pressure within. One of the great difficulties is that negative patterns in a person's life will be stored deep in the mind. The mind will try to release them by bringing them up to the surface as tangible sensations in that person's body. The difficulty, and once they're on the surface as tangible sensations in a person's body, then you can open up to them and they'll sort of break up. The difficulty is that in going from being suppressed in the deep mind to coming up to tangibility in the body, those sensations have to pass through a region where they are semi-conscious. And it's at that point that they become unbearable. It's in that semi-conscious region. Have you ever had the experience of like, I just don't want to sit. I just don't want to sit. Don't ask me why, I just don't want to sit. You're sitting really fine and then all of a sudden I just have this vague resistance to sitting. What's happening at that point is that certain things that were repressed are starting to work their way to the surface, but they haven't worked their way to the surface at all yet. They've just come into the intermediate region of the mind, of consciousness, which is very vulnerable. And at that point you can't pin down anything, you just know you feel that you just don't want to do this. That's because the sensations are in the region of greatest vulnerability. They're semi-conscious. Semi-conscious discomforts really get you. Does anybody agree? Does anybody know? Watch. If you can actually feel it with tangibility, you can deal with it easy. But it's that vague nebulous sort of stuff that may not be all that intense, but it's semi-conscious. That's your most vulnerable region of consciousness. It's like that in-between complete suppression and tangible awareness. There's this very vulnerable region of like subconscious semi-conscious. Okay. What typically happens in a depressed type situation is what the mind wants to do is throw out pain into the body, where it will be completely observable and hopefully the person will just be with it and it will break up. But it hits that vulnerable region of semi-awareness first. And down in that region, that semi-aware subconscious mind feels as though it is literally burnt all over. It is just in agony. The surface mind may have very little specific awareness. It just knows I don't feel good. But that region down there that is semi-conscious, it feels like every single part of the body is just in burning agony. Okay. Now, if you were burned all over your body, would you want to do anything? Okay. The slightest movement would enhance that discomfort. Even the slightest thinking, any movement at all, makes it so much worse. Okay. Well, as far as that semi-conscious region goes, it's burned all over. Any little purposeful movement that a person makes seems to make that sensation worse down there. So the person says, I'm depressed. I don't want to do anything. Okay. And life is not worth living. That's because the process of releasing hasn't been able to come to full tangibility. So what would have been a normal way that some pressure would have been released in the deep mind, somehow because of our human habits it gets obfuscated and gets stuck in an awkward region where it turns into dysfunctionality. Because I've had that experience, like, you know, feeling depressed for a few days and say, why am I depressed? Everything's great, you know. I'm doing exactly what I wanted. Then I realize, wait a minute, I'm not depressed. I'm absolutely not depressed at all. I'm just getting body memories of the way I used to feel when I was a kid and different times. That's all. I have absolutely no depression. It's just old memories coming to the surface, which if I pay attention to as body sensation and open up to, it dissolves and I feel, oh boy, something wonderful has been relieved from my deep mind. So it's a long answer to a short question, but I don't know much about it. I just have this feeling that depression often is a natural phenomenon of relief that gets somehow nipped in the bud, you might say, because of our human habits. Any other questions? The depression you just described is not what you were talking about earlier. I was talking about depression as a phenomenon in an ordinary type person. With the thing that you just described, if it is so hard to get through that, is it natural to continue to observe? It will work for some people, yes, to observe. You observe your depression, that's all. Observe the sensations, how they come and go, observe thoughts, how they come and go. If you can get enough motivation to observe the depression, then the technique of vipassana will work. Another thing that I've found to be very good with depression is to simply force myself to move. And I prepare myself that there's going to be a big burst of pain in my body. And I'm going to be aware and accepting of that. And then I just start to move. Any movement, just get up, walk around the room, whatever, and just open up to those waves of sensation and observe them. And then stuff starts breaking up. Okay, we have time for maybe one more question. Two more questions. No more questions? Yes? What if you have reason to be depressed? You still get the therapy, but also if you don't feel like, if you're not motivated, you have the motivation to do something, sometimes something about the outside world that makes you depressed. I would say that from a practical point of view, one often needs some external support to keep encouraging and pointing the way for one. So I can sort of describe what might be strategies that will work, but one may well need somebody to keep one focused on that strategy if one's going through a difficult period. So just like my saying it and you remembering it may not be enough, you may also need some input from the outside, some coaching or some encouragement to keep applying the strategy. On the other hand, on the positive side of the picture is that when a person has a difficulty coming up in their life, whatever that may be, fear, anger, depression, if you apply what I would call a spiritual strategy, then you will be transforming yourself. You won't just be dealing with that particular issue. You'll be setting in motion a process of evolution within yourself so that you will be, quote, getting something by going through this negativity. And not only that, the process of evolution that a person sets up in themselves when they take a spiritual approach to a life problem, that process of evolution is not a linear process. It is a snowballing process. So that there's a lot to sort of encourage a person to use a spiritual approach for some practical thing. A lot of times when we have a practical thing come up, we just want to, well, something's going to help me with this now. But the spiritual approach, the idea is that it's something that is not just going to help you with this now, but is going to set in motion a process of evolution that's going to influence you in many ways broadly for the rest of your life. And not only that, but that process of evolution is going to snowball, get faster and faster. So that is something that you can encourage yourself to use a spiritual approach. What would a spiritual approach be? I would say would be to take action, but take action with the viewpoint that you're taking action in order to meditate upon the resistance to taking action. Is that too convoluted a sentence? In other words, we're talking about, I think you're talking about resistance, right? Resistance to doing things? Yeah, sometimes you just don't have the will. That's right. So what one can do is, one can respond as best one can. Understanding that that response may not be very good. But the one thing that one can do is, even though one's response may not be all that good, one's meditation on the resistance can be very powerful. In other words, you can, well I'll give you an example. Like I hate to do the dishes. This is a minor thing, but I hate to do the dishes. Even though it seems like a minor thing, actually there's no minor things. Shelley can confirm this. At times when I was working with the resistance to doing the dishes, okay, I'd be laying in bed very comfortably and Shelley says, you know, come do the dishes. It's your turn, you've got to do the dishes. Okay. Now, I know I have a lot of resistance to doing the dishes. And how am I going to practice? I'm going to watch my resistance to doing the dishes as feelings of achy heaviness in my body associated with getting up and actually having to take action. Okay. How long did it take me to get from my bed to the kitchen? How long did it take? Five, ten minutes? Remember when I did that? Well, I had to walk in slow motion, it hurt so much. Okay. It was just like excruciating. I wanted to feel every little part of that resistance and I had chosen the aspect of the mind-body called body sensations to observe at that time. Because I knew that the resistance would come up very clearly as a feeling of heaviness and ache at the prospect of having to do the dishes. Okay. Next time you find yourself paralyzed in bed, just feel what it's like to get up. Okay. Open up to those sensations. If you've learned how to deal with one kind of pain, you can deal with another kind of pain. It's just physical pain, okay, but physical pain at that awkward, intermediate, semi-conscious state. Okay. So I decided I'm going to make it completely conscious. So like in slow motion, like a burn victim trying to get out of bed, okay. Because that's exactly what it was like at that level. Okay. Very, very slowly. Just feeling each impact of just like the agony of extending my hand, okay, the agony. And just like in slow motion, very, very gingerly, just feeling all that and walking and like crying, okay, moaning like a little baby. And just like in slow motion doing the dishes and crying. What I'm saying is I did not do a very efficient job of the dishes. Okay. It took a long time. I was literally weeping and crying and, you know, it was like not just crying, it was maudlin crying, okay. Right, remember? Okay, but stuff was getting worked through. So I wasn't very efficient at the dishes, but I changed, fundamentally changed. The next time I was able, you know, there wasn't the sense of resistance there that I had before. Okay, it became effortless, easy to do it, it became fun to do it. It took several times of this sort of very inefficient, I wasn't in other words getting up to do an efficient job of doing the dishes. I was getting up to do an efficient job of meditating on my difficulty with doing the dishes. And by doing that just a few times, now I get to have a whole lifetime of being able to do the dishes. Okay, so it's like lancing a boil. It's like you can either carry that boil with you and bandage it over and sort of protect it for your whole life. Or you can say, damn it, I'm going to get rid of it. Now it's real painful for a minute, but then it's gone. Yes? You have to deal with it while you're sitting. Correct. Hopefully, actually though, you'd be able to at least at some level actually deal with the person. And simultaneously watch, because you don't want to become too much like a vegetable except during sitting periods. You have to give your clue first. Yes, that's right. Exactly. You could apply it to anything. In other words, what always tends to happen is that when we're faced with a specific circumstance, we're always thinking about, what am I going to do about this specific circumstance? And we're not putting too much energy or thought into, well, this is just like I'm going to have this same kind of circumstance come up hundreds of times in my life. Maybe I'll learn something from this one, and then it will be easier the next time. And then I'll learn something the next time more, and it'll be easier still, and easier still, like that. We tend to get very much into the specifics of the circumstance. So, yes, it would be exactly like that. You would say, well, maybe I can't deal with this person too well, but I will be able to meditate on my difficulty well. And then it will be much easier as time goes on. Right. Yes. Anything else? It's the same thing. The way you go over, I didn't say by motivation, I said by momentum. That's a difference. That's a big difference. The way you get over the pit of emptiness is by momentum, a habit pattern that you establish. To observe the pit. So it's actually saying exactly the same thing. If you find yourself inactive, then you act and watch what impact that has as you're acting. I'll take one last question here. Yes. I was just curious about the interaction. It's interesting. Of course, for me, politics is just individual written large. It's like the same kind of things that go on between two people go on between two nations. Except when you think about it in that sense, if you look at what goes on between the Soviet Union and the United States, it's a little bit disconcerting, because it's sort of like five-year-olds in the sandlot. It's at that level, isn't it? So that nations, it seems that since nations are larger individuals, they evolve slower. It's going to take a long time before nations start to get civil with each other, I guess, even civil. But it would be interesting to apply it at that level, but it's damn hard to apply it just between you and me. You'd say nothing of these huge, cumbrous structures called political entities. That's a good point. Well, I said that was the last question, and it's 12 o'clock. Let me make a couple of announcements first. Thank you for reminding me that there are announcements. First of all, next week I'm going to talk about some approaches to calming the mind. So it's sort of in contrast to today's talk. Today's talk was relevant to somebody that may be practicing 10, 15 years. You'll get into the dark night of the soul. But the first thing that you worry about when you sit down and meditate is how am I going to calm my mind. So that's what I'm going to talk about next week.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " Today I'd like to speak on the topic of the dark night of the soul.",
