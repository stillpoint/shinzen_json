{"text": " a few words to introduce to you the vipassana practice. First of all, it is pronounced vipassana, and I'd like you to actually say it so it becomes familiar on your lips, so that when you leave this retreat and your friend said, what kind of meditation was that that you did, you won't say vipassana. Now, it's true that even if you can't pronounce it properly, if you do it properly, you'll get enlightenment. And even if you do pronounce it with a perfect classic pronunciation, if you don't practice it, you won't get enlightenment. In fact, the senior vipassana teacher in the United States that I know of, the first person to introduce the practice here back in the 1950s was Robert Hover. And we had him lead a retreat at my center. We sort of brought him out of retirement. I was glad we were able to do that. And he comes from Montana, and to this day he says vipassana, okay? But it didn't stop him from becoming completely enlightened. However, I would like you to pronounce it the way it is pronounced. It's a word in the Pali language, which is one of the ancient languages of India, along with Sanskrit. In fact, Pali is a kind of simplified Sanskrit. Vipassana. Can you say it? Vipassana. Right. Vipassana. Right. In the Sanskrit form of the word, it's almost the same. That's the way Hoshin pronounced it, vipassana. The only difference is it's a sa versus a sha sound. In Sanskrit, vipassana. In Pali, vipassana. Most people use the Pali form of the word. The vipassana practice is the representative practice associated with a school of Buddhism called the Theravada School of Buddhism. That's spelled T-H-E-R-A-V-A-D-A. And the Theravada School of Buddhism is found primarily in the Southeast Asian countries of Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka used to be called Ceylon. Thailand used to be called Siam. But the practice of vipassana and the Theravada School of Buddhism did not develop in those countries. They come from India originally. In India, Theravada form of Buddhism was one of about 16 schools of Buddhism that preserved the early practice as the Buddha himself had taught it in its sort of early simple form. As time went on, after the Buddha's death, the Buddha lived about 2,500 years ago, other practices developed that were evolutions from his teaching. Something called Mahayana and then out of that something called Vajrayana. Mahayana means the great vehicle. Vajrayana means the diamond vehicle. But people that held to the early rather simple and unelaborated, unevolved practice as the Buddha had taught it came to be called Hinayana, which literally means the small vehicle, as opposed to Mahayana, which is the great vehicle. And there were about 16 schools of Hinayana, of which Theravada was one. So I know that this may seem like a lot of technical information, but I think many of you will read books about the history and you'd like to know where the practice comes from. So put simply, vipassana is the representative practice of the Theravada School of Buddhism. The Theravada School of Buddhism is sometimes called Southern Buddhism because it's in Southeast Asia. It's sometimes called Pali Buddhism because it uses this language Pali, which is very similar to the language the Buddha himself spoke. He didn't speak Sanskrit. He spoke a colloquial language rather like Pali. But it is also sometimes called Hinayana Buddhism, or small vehicle, because it is the sole survivor of the Hinayana tradition. And Hinayana simply is a historical label for early Buddhism. Now, why is it called small vehicle as opposed to large vehicle is something that I don't have time to go into now, but you can simply know this as just a simple term, just like you have Presbyterians. Why are they called Presbyterians? Well, there's a reason, but we just use it as a noun. We call them Presbyterians or Baptists, what have you. So the early Buddhists are sometimes referred to as Hinayana. The discovery that the Buddha made, that made him the Buddha, the awakened one, was an extraordinary discovery. I rank it as one of the major discoveries of our human species. There's the discovery of fire, there's the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem, there's a few very, very basic important things that cultures discover, the human species has discovered. And what the Buddha discovered ranks as one of these very fundamental, very important things. What he discovered was that if we bring the quality of exceedingly precise observation to the ordinary flow of experience, the operation of these six senses, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body, and the thinking mind, if we bring an extraordinary degree of precise attention to the ordinary flow of the senses, and at the same time we bring a quality of not interfering with the operation of the senses, simply allowing hearing to play itself out as hearing, seeing to arise as seeing, the feelings in the body to spread and move and dance their dance, live their life as they wish, and the thoughts to come and go in their own natural pattern. If we bring to this ordinary flow of experience an extraordinary degree of attentiveness and non-interference, then we initiate a process and that process has two aspects. One is an aspect of the development of deep insight. We start to get understandings, understandings that are not merely related to our individual life and our individual personality, but understandings that are deeper than the specifics of our life. We get understandings into the generic issues, what is the nature of suffering, and how can we experience pain without it turning into suffering, physical pain, psychological pain, of any cause, of any quality, of any intensity. How can we experience, we have to feel, we're feeling beings, we're not rocks. How can we experience pain without it getting in the way of the perfection of the moment? We get insight, we actually see how that can be directly. How can we experience pleasure in a way that we get really lasting satisfaction, that it does not become a compulsion and that our base level of fulfillment is permanently changed by having experienced the pleasure? Usually when we experience pleasure, it does not change our baseline of fulfillment, it does not transform how we live the rest of our life. And in fact, usually it turns into craving and need and drivenness. So how can we, we must experience pain in this life, how can we experience pain without it getting in the way of the perfection of the moment? We must experience pleasure in this life, how can we experience pleasure with really lasting satisfaction and without it becoming neediness? What is the nature of the experience of self? What is the nature of the experience of oneness? What is the substance of experience? Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body and the thinking mind. Ultimately, out of what atoms are these experiences built? The self and the world. Subjectively speaking, as arising in consciousness, what are they made out of? If we observe very carefully under a microscope, the cells of the tissues of the human body, we can actually see what those tissues are made out of and there would be no way that we could know the cell theory of life without a microscope to observe the structure of life. With the naked eye, it's not at all evident. Through logic, it is not at all evident that our bodies are built of teeny, trillions of teeny little cells. So in the same way, it is not at all evident to the average person what the substance of experience is, even though that person will live their entire life in the world of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body and the thinking mind. They will never know at a microscopic level the single substance out of which that experience is built. So one of the things that happens as we bring the quality of precise observation and non-interference to the flow of these senses is that we go through not just one, but a sequence of ever deepening insights into very, very fundamental and broad issues. And of course, when a fundamental issue is cracked, then we have a powerful tool to deal with the specific issues. I'm angry about this, or I'm frightened about that, or I'm sad about that, or I'm not getting enough satisfaction from this. I'm not getting fulfillment in that. All of those specific issues become immediately resolved when we resolve the general issues. So we're talking about heavy guns, we're talking about deep work, and we're talking about an unfolding of fundamental insight that will go on throughout your whole life, a sequence of ever deepening understandings. I mentioned that a process that involves two aspects is initiated by precise observation with non-interference. The second aspect, in addition to the sequence of insights, a person goes through a sequence of releases. Releases of the stored poison and pain of a lifetime, releases of the forces that limit perception and behavior. We all notice year after year, the same limiting forces on our behavior seem to act however much we may want to change. However much the surface mind says it wants to live a certain way, there's some force in the depth of the mind that prevents that from happening. Year after year, the same limiting forces are influencing behavior. And second by second, instant by instant, we are aware that our perceptions are less than beatific. For most people, it doesn't seem like sitting in this room right now, listening to this talk, being a little sleepy at night, that we're sitting in paradise. It seems like less than paradise here. But that's only because of these limiting forces that are acting upon us. If we were free from those limiting forces, as we become free from those limiting forces, more and more ordinary experiences, just sitting around, listening to people talk, riding in the car, seem to be like a blessing, like a prayer, beatific, spiritual. This is what in the Christian tradition was called the practice of the presence of God. It meant you didn't have to do special prayers. The ordinary operation of your senses became prayers because the true spiritual nature of the substance of experience was evident to you. So, the forces that keep us in the same negative behavior patterns year after year and prevent the operation of ordinary experience from being a spiritual transcendent experience, those forces percolate up to the surface as yucky states of the body and agitated states of the mind. And what happens is, as they boil up to the surface as we sit here, we just observe them. We don't do anything at all. We just are very precise and allow them to dance their dance. So we don't reinforce them. We don't react to them by either going unconscious or by buying into them or by pushing away. Usually when a negative force arises within a person, the person will either try to anesthetize themselves by turning away or maybe actually drugging themselves or distracting themselves or they will reject that negativity and long for it to go away and resist it or they will buy into it and identify with it and act on it. But in addition to buying into it or trying to push it away or trying to ignore it, there's another possibility. Watch it with detachment. If we try to push it away or if we try to turn away from it or if we try to, or if we identify with it, then we recharge that negativity. But if we just observe it and remain very, very conscious, its energy becomes dissipated each time it arises. Like a battery, it eventually loses its source of energy and dies. So in addition to the sequence of insights, really deep and fascinating spiritual insights that a person goes through, they go through a sequence of releases, of blockages, of negative forces, of stored, undigested life material. It's going to come up as you sit. In fact, I don't want to scare anybody away from this retreat, but it's entirely possible that most of the time as you sit there, your experience is going to be two things. Your body's going to be uncomfortable and your mind's going to be agitated. Now I know that doesn't sound like a very appealing advertisement for a weekend of vipassana practice. However, what you're going to discover is that you're going to be relating to those phenomena differently than you would relate to them in daily life, because you're here to meditate and you're going to be given resources. There's a technique. So that your mind will be agitated and you'll just observe that. Your body will be yucky and you'll just observe that. And as the result of that, you'll find that even though you may well have spent the whole weekend just with the mind wandering and the body feeling yucky, when you go back, things have changed. Things that used to bother you won't bother you so much. Feelings of separation and alienation that were always there suddenly aren't there anymore. Your base level of feeling fulfilled with even simple things seems to have gone up. Just the simple things of having a piece of toast or driving down the road seems to have a heightened sense of brightness and wonder. It's because, although you weren't aware of it at the time, the blockages to happiness, the sources of unhappiness, were welling up as you were sitting here. And you were actually working them off, literally watching them to death. That's what vipassana is. It's watching the sources of unhappiness to death. If you go out there and actively try to slay them, they just get stronger and stronger. But if you allow them to play themselves out and watch, then they will simply die a natural death quite gracefully. So we're going to practice two things. One is that we're going to take ordinary experience and develop an extraordinary degree of precision in awareness. And that precision in awareness, that continuity of awareness, that clarity of awareness, that discernment in awareness is called mindfulness, or in the sense, in the Pali, sati, S-A-T-I. The second thing we're going to be cultivating is we're going to give permission for the senses to simply operate. And we're going to not interfere. So if we have a pain in the leg and it wants to spread, we're going to let it spread. If we're feeling sleepy and there's a sleepy sensation and it wants to move in a certain way through the body, we're going to let it move that way. It doesn't mean that if it's hot, we're going to observe heat. Now it also means, it doesn't mean that we'll fail to open the windows or turn on the thermostat. But we'll take a stance as far as the circumstances go. We're not going to be passive about circumstances, but we are going to have an attitude of non-interfering with the actual operation of the senses themselves. And that attitude of non-interfering with the flow of experience is technically called equanimity. From the Latin, equis animus, meaning a balanced consciousness. A sense of balance, not being knocked off balance because of the different states that come up. So we're going to be cultivating two things with respect to ordinary experience. We'll be cultivating mindfulness and equanimity. This is going to also result in two things. Insights will begin to come, understandings, aha experiences. And the impurities in consciousness, the blockages, the sources of unhappiness, will come to the surface and they'll be observed and they'll literally boil off. And when the sources of unhappiness have been evacuated, then our natural state of happiness will become evident. Just as if there's a window and it's covered with dirt, if you clean away the dirt, the sun that was always there can shine through. You don't create the sun. So in this practice, we can't create enlightenment. We don't attempt to create enlightenment. It's already there. We're not trying to seek God. We're trying to rather do a methodical practice which will clean away the thing that stands between us and God. Of course, Buddhists usually don't use the word God, but if you want to use that word, we have a different word that we use, nirvana, the source, the state of true, our ground state, wherein we know true and final repose. In the West, they call it God, but we have our reasons. We use other words. But in any event, you can't turn towards that, but what you can do is turn away from everything that's not that, and then that which is always there will shine through. So what vipassana means is, the reason we use the Pali word is vipassana means the practice of the observation. It means the purification or releasing of blockages that comes through that observation, and it means also the insights that come. So it's a single word that comprises both the sense of observing, the sense of understanding, and the sense of purification or releasing or catharsis. There's no exact English equivalent that corresponds to the Pali word vipassana. So this is in essence what we came here to practice. I mentioned that vipassana is the style of meditation that is associated with the Theravada school of Buddhism. Theravada school of Buddhism is the surviving, sole surviving representative of the Hinayana tradition. The Hinayana tradition is early Buddhism. Within vipassana, there are different styles. There's the Upakin lineage, the Mahasi Sayadaw lineage, the Taung Phulu lineage, the Ajahn Chah lineage, the Buddhadasa lineage, etc. etc. The Sun Lun lineage, etc. etc. How do these lineages differ? Well, first it's important to realize they all agree on the fundamentals. We bring mindfulness and equanimity to experience and that initiates a sequence of deep insights and radical releases of blockages. All the lineages agree on that. Where there is disagreement is in two areas. What should be the primary aspect of experience that we meditate on, that we observe? I mentioned we have six senses. Hearings, seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling, which is the body sense, all the different senses that come up in the body, and thinking. By the way, just as a clarification, it may seem a little strange to you that thinking is considered a sense mode like hearing and seeing, but according to Buddhist psychological theory, thinking is just another sense. You detect things about the world through seeing the world, you detect things about the world through hearing, and you detect things about the world through thinking about the world. The body sensations are the conduit into pure feeling. Animals feel, they feel in the body. Babies feel, they feel in the body. What we have as adults and what we often call feeling, the emotions, according to Buddhist theories, are the combination of two things. It's a tangle of ideas and body sensations. That's what an emotion is. Part of it is an idea. You're walking down the street and you hear somebody behind you. In my neighborhood, in Los Angeles, I live in downtown LA, the heart of the cocaine dealing area, and a very bad part of town. If I'm walking and I hear a couple guys walking behind me, a thought arises. In this part of town, these guys are probably marking me. That's an idea. That's thinking. When that thought arises, something erupts in the chest. Something erupts in the back. There's a weak feeling in the knees. There's a creepy feeling that goes up the back of my head. There is a tightened feeling that happens in my gut. There's a shaky feeling that happens in my arms. There is a throbbing feeling that happens in my heart. There is a tense feeling that happens in my feet because I'm about to maybe run or something. Those are the feeling part of the fear. The ideas are the thinking part. When those get tangled together, we have the emotion called fear. The different vipassana teachers have some disagreements. Being vipassana teachers, they hardly come to blows over these disagreements, but there is definitely some difference of opinion. Enlightened arguments, that's always interesting to watch. Anyway, it's just like doctors. You can have two very well qualified doctors that speak with tremendous confidence. They have different opinions because they've had different experience. Vipassana teachers are like that. They by and large speak with tremendous confidence because they've literally seen lives saved, just like doctors by this practice. But they have different opinions about what should be the primary object of meditation. Out of these six senses, what should people work with? Should they take something very small and work for penetration? Or should they take a broader section of experience and work for coverage? Some vipassana teachers, for example, Buddha Dasa in Thailand, a very famous teacher, would describe the entire path of vipassana meditation, 20 years, 30 years of learning, all learning about one aspect of experience, the physical sensation of breath. Just that. Just penetrating deeper and deeper into the detailed reality of what the physical sensation of the body breathing is like. It's a very small object, but they can take you the entire path of all the stages of release and liberation through just that one object. Other vipassana teachers, for example, in the Upa-Khin lineage, as is exemplified by S. N. Goenka and Robert Hover, Ruth Dennison, other teachers in that lineage, the primary object of meditation is the body sensations. Broader than just the body sensation of the breath. Any and all body sensations because they would say the breath alone is too narrow. And when the emotions come up, our primary blockages and problems as human beings comes up as emotions. Most of emotion is body sensation when you look carefully. If you work with the body as your object of vipassana meditation, the body becomes exceedingly sensitized and vibrant. It becomes like a high resolution computer screen and your entire emotional life is displayed in three dimensions in real time, moment by moment, as waves of sensation in the body. It's always happening, but most people can't detect it. So they are subject to it. By it, I mean these subtle sensations. So they would say work with the body sensations because that's the conduit into pure feeling and the fundamental blockages arise around feeling. Other vipassana teachers, for example, in the Mahasi lineage from Burma, would have you work with all of the six senses simultaneously, cover the whole sensory sphere, because they say that's what's happening and you need to work with what's evident and prominent. So there is disagreement with respect, I don't know, disagreement might be too strong a word, but there are different styles of vipassana that differ with respect to what is going to be the primary object of meditation. The other thing that differs is what procedure, what technique, what strategy are we going to use to assure that once we have chosen the object of meditation, we bring the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity to it. And there are different strategies like sweeping or noting. Some of these will be explained to you during this retreat. What you get with me as is rather typical of Western vipassana teachers is you get something that's eclectic. I've studied within the various lineages and I tend to use aspects of all of them because I see them in a unified way. And you're also getting here the practice modified for you as Westerners. By that I mean that the practice is going to be presented in a very, in a sort of modern vocabulary. And also the way that we set up the practice where you get a lot of personal attention and there's no guru on a throne here. It's just an informal kind of situation. This is set up for the social environment in the West where things are more equal. I don't expect you to believe them just because I say them as the teacher. You can challenge them. So what you are getting is a Westernized form of vipassana and you're getting a vipassana that draws from the different lineages, not just one. So now you have a pretty good idea of sort of what you signed up for. What we're going to do as our first object of meditation, because during the retreat I'm going to start you out with a narrow object and then I'm going to give you a broader and broader focus as time goes on. And we'll start out with the narrowest of objects that's traditionally used which is the physical sensation of breath. And we'll be doing that tonight and a part of tomorrow. And then at the next discussion I'll be, and during some of the guided meditations tomorrow morning, I'll be broadening you in terms of your object. Traditionally the location used for working with the breath will either be the moment by moment changing sensation at the tip of, at the nostrils around either the rings of the nostrils or just at the upper lip or at the nasal septum, which is the divider between the nostrils. Wherever in that sort of triangular area you detect sensation, you can take that as your object of meditation. What's happening is a little wind is blowing in and out along the nostrils there as you breathe and its velocity is constantly changing. And as its velocity changes, the pressure changes, the pressure of the air and therefore the physical chain senses there. Sensations are constantly changing. You can take one way of working with the breath is to take that as your object of meditation and pour the qualities of mindfulness, of careful observation, be aware of each minute little fluctuation microsecond by microsecond. The second location you can use and you should choose one or the other, whichever one seems natural to you. The alternative location is the physical sensation of the abdomen going up and down or in and out. See which one is most natural for you and stay with that. Don't shift back and forth. It occasionally happens that somebody cannot detect the breath either at the tip of the nose or at the abdomen, but they detect it in the chest or over the whole body. If that's the case for you and you so desire, then take that location and focus in where you prominently experience the breath. In terms of posture, you can sit with your legs crossed in the lotus posture or you can use what's called the half lotus, which is that one leg is up on one thigh and the other leg is under. Or you can use various more relaxed postures that they sometimes call quarter lotus, what we call sitting Indian style. There's something called seiza, which means you tuck your legs behind and you use either a bench or your cushion. Perhaps you use your cushion vertically to prop you up. Seiza is the Japanese formal way of sitting, but in Japan they don't prop you up with a cushion. You have to have your ankles and your whole body directly on the floor. So that's pretty uncomfortable. But if you prop yourself up, you can use the seiza posture. You can also sit in a chair. Sit with your back straight, though don't lean up against the back of the chair. So this is how we'll be beginning for tonight. We'll have a little period of meditation, working with the breath, and then as you lie in bed tonight before you go to sleep, continue to meditate on the breath. Let that be the last thing that happens. When you wake up in the morning for just a couple minutes before you get out of bed, reestablish your awareness on the breath. There's a very famous vipassana teacher, Upandita, and he's famous as a very strict teacher. He's Burmese. And one of the things he's known to ask when you go for interviews is, he asks you what's happening in your practice. And one of the famous things that he asks people are sort of infamous things. When you went to bed last night, just before you lost consciousness and fell asleep, was that on an in-breath or an out-breath? And if you hesitate in answering, you get bawled out. I'm not joking. He actually expects you to know that. And when you woke up in the morning, when you first regained consciousness, were you breathing in or were you breathing out? So this is what we mean by mindfulness. So you can experiment. I won't bawl you out if you can't remember. So are there any questions about that? That's where we're going to start, but that's not where we're going to finish the retreat. But it's a good place to start. This is technically the aspect of vipassana that is called anapanasati. Sati means mindfulness. Ana is the in-breath. Pana is the out-breath. Pana is in Pali, it's prana in Sanskrit, some of you may know, meaning the breathing forth, the prana. So anapanasati is the mindfulness of the in and the out-breath, and it's a subset of the vipassana practice. Except for those, some teachers say that that's enough. You can do the whole practice just with that. So if there are no questions, as you do that, you try to sit as still as possible. Because, well, there are a number of reasons to sit still. But one of them is that every time you move the body in some little way, it makes a gap or a break in the mindfulness. So we'll do a bit of that mindfulness of the breathing tonight, now, and then we'll be going to bed around 10.30. I'll talk a little bit about the aspect of posture. What's magic about posture in sitting is not that the legs are twisted up in some particular shape. The important thing is that the body is held upright, but at the same time, there is a complete relaxation. So you can sit in a chair, that's just fine. And as I say, you can alternate sitting on the floor. In whatever posture you take, though, you want to keep sort of touching base, make sure that you're not slouching, that the back is straight, and that you're letting the whole body just settle. So you maintain the posture, not by an act of effort, but by finding a position of equilibrium, balance, and then letting the whole body sort of hang from the spine. Now, I know that when you begin your meditation practice, it's much easier to relax if you're leaning up against something. And of course, the easiest to relax of all is if you're lying down on the floor. But what happens then is that relaxation is happening to you. You're not really learning how to relax the body into a posture. So at the beginning, it may seem like an awful lot of labor to try to keep the back straight and keep sort of settling into the posture. But it will pay off. If you're going to make meditation part of your life, it's good to get a good meditation posture at the beginning. The metaphor that I usually give is that it's like when a person learns how to type. If you sit down at a typewriter the first day, if you hunt and peck with your finger, you can actually type something. But there's no potential for growth there. Six months later, you'll still be typing at the same speed. So if when you first meditate, you do your meditation lying down or you slouch, it's true, right away you'll feel some relaxation. But there'll be a limit as to how far you can grow. Whereas if you make an effort to keep straightening the spine and then relaxing into it, what's happening is that you're actually learning how to relax the body and at the same time keep it alert. And eventually, the people that work on the posture at the beginning are able to make much better progress than the other people. So when you sit down, if you try to touch type, it's a very awkward exercise and you can't type out anything the first day. It seems like, why should I put myself through this awkward exercise of making my fingers move in these unnatural ways? But eventually, the person that learns to touch type has a method that will become very, very efficient. So although it may seem a little bit more awkward and unnatural at the beginning, try to work a little bit with the posture because it will pay off an awful lot in the future. As I say, it's not necessary that you twist your legs into a pretzel and sit in the full lotus. If you can sit in the half lotus, now a true half lotus has one of the feet all the way up on the other thigh. If you can sit in the half lotus, that's fine. Your legs will eventually stretch. And if you sit in the quarter lotus, your legs will also stretch. So your body will adapt to this posture. If it's any consolation, when I first started to meditate, I could only get my legs about halfway down. This is as far as they would go. And it took me three years of doing yoga and sitting to where I could just barely get into the full lotus. And then it took me about eight more years to be able to sit in the full lotus for, let's say, two hours. But I can now sit in this position with my legs crossed for two hours quite comfortably, whereas I can't sit in a chair for two hours comfortably without moving at all. So, as I say, it's good to learn these postures since most of you will be continuing with your meditation practice. One of the things that comes up as we're sitting here that I'm sure many of you have been thinking is I got better things to do with my time than sit here and feel the discomforts of my knees aching, my back aching, being sleepy, the pressures on the body, etc. We have a very strong conditioning to associate physical discomfort with something that has no redeeming feature whatsoever. It's true, isn't it? Our basic human conditioning, the basic conditioning of the species, is if we have discomfort, something's wrong. And things will only be right when that discomfort has been eliminated. Now, of course, it's entirely true that we can do certain things, we can manipulate circumstances, so as to minimalize discomfort in our lives. And as human beings, it's completely legitimate to do so. If you have a headache, you can take an aspirin. If you're feeling sleepy, you can rest. But will we always be able to find ways of alleviating discomfort? No. It's true, isn't it, that there are going to be discomforts that arise that there's no aspirin for, correct? Not only in the realm of the physical discomforts, but also in the realm of emotional discomforts. Lots of things come up in daily life, that no matter how we may try to manipulate circumstances, there is a pain or a discomfort that cannot be avoided. If a human being always associates happiness only with the absence of discomfort, then when those inevitable discomforts come up that cannot be avoided, then that human being cannot be happy. And if the discomfort is intense, that human being will be intensely unhappy. And if the discomfort lasts for a long time, that person's reason to live may even go away, because there's no redeeming feature. There's nothing that can be done. One has fallen into hell. What we do on these retreats is, of course, a many-faceted learning. But one of the things that we learn is that there is a redeeming feature to discomfort, be that discomfort intense or subtle, be that discomfort from gross physical causes or from psychological causes. We discover that it is possible to develop a kind of skill whereby when we experience discomfort with that skill, we feel the energy in that discomfort cleaning us out and empowering us. This, of course, is a radical shift in paradigm, a radical shift in the ordinary human way of looking at things. But unless a person can come to that, unless a person can come to that experience, they will be destined to have terrible suffering in their life. And it's not particularly difficult to retrain consciousness so as to be able to relate to discomfort as something that purifies and empowers. It only takes a bit of time and a bit of effort. It's not something that you're going to learn perfectly on your first retreat or even at your fifth retreat. But with time, it does sink in. You all are familiar with the process of vaccination, aren't you? What happens when you give somebody a vaccination? What happens? What's the procedure? A vaccination means that you give a person a manageable dose of the disease. It's not overwhelming. It's just a little bit of it. And that person's body will learn from that manageable dose of the disease how to fight off the actual disease. Now, it's undeniably true that at retreats like this, you're going to get some discomforts. We're not used to sitting in these postures. The body hurts. We get bored. We get sleepy. Different types of things like that come up. Relative to the intensities of discomfort that all of us will be subject to in daily life, the discomforts that we encounter at these retreats are very minor, very, very small. They are, in point of fact, manageable doses. And in the environment of the retreat, we have the optimal learning environment. In daily life, you're likely to get intense doses of discomfort, number one. And number two, those discomforts may be in a circumstance where it is very difficult to learn anything from that discomfort. In this environment, you get small discomforts and you're in the perfect circumstance to learn. And how does the learning take place? Actually, it takes place naturally, just by the fact of sitting still and paying attention. That's all we have to do. The rest is just a matter of time. There is a natural learning mechanism within us. The body knows how to experience physical and psychological discomfort without suffering, but we have to give it half a chance to learn that lesson. So as we're sitting here, and if it should happen to you that discomfort comes up, then very likely the old conditioning will be there. Oh, this is bad. I've got to get away from this. I've got to relieve it. I shouldn't be doing this. Or I'm feeling uncomfortable because I'm doing something wrong. That's the old conditioning. What we're going to try to do is replace that by a fundamentally different new conditioning. Oh, discomfort is coming up? Okay. If I bring the qualities of attention and acceptance to that discomfort, then I am training consciousness to be able to experience that discomfort without suffering. At first, this training is very subtle. You may not really realize that it's happening. You may sit the whole retreat only thinking about escaping. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but when I started to meditate, I never completed one retreat. I always found a reason to escape. And at the time, the reason seemed so cogent, so compelling. It was just obvious to me that the best thing I could do for my practice at that time, the best thing I could do for my spiritual development was leave the retreat. Then I would really grow, then I would really learn, then I would be able to nurture myself, etc., etc. And I actually bought into those thoughts several times. But I would always come back to the retreats, even though I would leave. I would always do another one and another one, until I realized that those thoughts were quite delusional and that actually the best thing that you can do in most cases, I mean there are exceptions, but in most cases the best thing you could do is sit there and continue to work. So at first, you may not actually feel effects as you're sitting. Your subjective experience as you're sitting may just be the body feels crummy and your mind's wandering. But after the retreat, you notice something's changed and you realize that learning was taking place, even though you didn't know it at the time. As you come back more and more as you do this practice regularly, you do a little sitting each day, you do these retreats every few months, the results start to, the effects of the practice start to be a little bit more quick or evident. And you reach a point after a little bit of time where you can feel the purification and the releasing that goes on after each sit. You'll do one sit and you'll feel you've changed. There is a distinctive feeling that I cannot possibly describe to you, but I hope that most of you will eventually come to know. There is a distinctive feeling that takes place in consciousness when we have an uncomfortable sensation in a skillful way. There's a certain good feeling that happens when you skillfully experience a bad feeling. Skillfully means you bring the qualities of attention and acceptance to it. And what that feeling is, is I can only describe it as a feeling of being cleaned out or alternatively a feeling of being empowered. And once you start to be able to detect that feeling, then your entire life changes because your basic human conditioning that you received in infancy is being turned around. You still avoid discomfort just like any other human being, of course, no matter how enlightened a person is, they don't actively seek discomfort and they avoid discomfort if they can find it, but what if they can avoid it. But what will happen is that you will know for sure any discomfort, mild or intense, that comes up in your life. You will be able to experience a positive aspect to that. You will be able to experience right then and there the qualities of empowering and cleansing, purification and fortification of your being. So that for the average person, the more intense discomfort is and the longer it lasts, the more they sour on life and the weaker they become, the more broken down they become. We're talking about fundamentally redirecting that so that the more discomfort a person passes through, the cleaner and clearer and more empowered that person becomes. And it is possible. Now there's several things that I really have to add here, lest misunderstandings arise. There is much more to the practice of meditation than just learning how to experience physical and emotional discomfort in a way that that discomfort is cleansing and empowering. But it is an aspect of the experience. The second thing that people often, so you shouldn't think that that's all that we're dealing with here. The second thing that people often misunderstand is, if we bring a quality of acceptance to the flow of sensation in the body, then there's a tendency to think that, oh, if I'm passive, if I just accept these sensations, if I'm passive on the inside, if I allow the sensations to dance their dance, live their life inside of me, even if they're painful, then that means that I'm going to be passive on the outside, that I'm not going to take a stand when I should take a stand, that I'm not going to be able to respond when I should respond, that I'm going to become indifferent and ineffective in daily life. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. This understanding that we human beings have as a species. The confusion between the two kinds of passivity, internal passivity, which is the attitude of not interfering with the flow of the senses, and external passivity, which is the attitude of not taking a stand with respect to the flow of life. In this practice, we learn how to be internally passive. That's true. Internally passive simply means not fighting with yourself, not creating internal friction. The energy that is bound up in internal friction inside human beings is enormously significant, and it is not detected, it is not known. People don't realize it because they've become acclimated to it. You only start realizing how much energy you're wasting fighting yourself when you start to get something to contrast to that, a state of not fighting yourself. And most people at the microscopic level are constantly tussling on the inside without even realizing it. The pain wants to move a certain way in my leg right now. Another part of my being is interfering with it, and before I even feel the pain, I've already resisted its movement and spread. So by the time I feel the pain, it's already turned into a problem called suffering. But if I observe, that habit will train away, and there will just be the movement of the pain without the pressure building up of the subtle resistance. And then I'll just feel something like a flow of energy. What is the effect on the efficiency of a car if you don't oil it? What happens to your car, to its fuel consumption? Does the fuel consumption go up? Why? Because if the car is not properly oiled, then there's a lot of friction among the moving parts of the engine, and that friction causes heat, which does no productive work. But in order for that heat to be produced, fuel is being used. In the same way, there is subtle friction in the processing of these six senses, in the flow of these six senses, especially in the flow of body sensation. And that subtle friction uses up an enormous amount of energy. So what meditators learn how to do is not fight on the inside. They become accepting of, they're able to detect and accept the way that the body sensations, and in fact all of the senses, want to flow. They detect it and accept it, and therefore the energy that was being wasted in subtly fighting the flow of the senses, particularly the flow of the body, that energy is now freed up and can be used to be effective in life. So far from leading to a passive or indifferent attitude towards life, when you have an internal passivity, it actually frees up energy for external activity and taking a stand. So I just mention this because you will find that from time to time you'll be thinking that way. You'll be afraid to just let the sensations move and to surrender to the subjective flow of feeling because there'll be an idea that somehow that's capitulation, that's going to make you helpless, that's going to make you indifferent and passive. So whenever a person brings the qualities of attention and acceptance, mind, in other words, to use the more traditional Buddhist vocabulary, mindfulness and equanimity, whenever a person brings that to an uncomfortable sensation, whether that person is aware of it or not, there is a process of purification going on. The way that we know that the purification is working, the sign that purification is happening, is that suffering, that is to say the pain being a problem, diminishes. As I say, when you begin your practice, it may take several retreats before you notice that your baseline of suffering in day-to-day life has somehow lessened. But as you continue the practice, eventually you reach the point where, let's say you're experiencing a pain in your knee as I am now from the posture, you're able to detect that that pain is not a single thing but a sequence of waves, and you're able to detect the wave of pain welling up, and you drop the resistance to it, and the pain breaks up into a kind of energy and you feel it cleaning you out, and then the next wave of pain comes up and you detect that as a distinct event, you drop your resistance to it, you see how it wants to dance, how it wants to move, how it wants to change, you let it do that, and you feel that pain become not pain but a wave of energy that's cleaning you out. And likewise, moment by moment, wave by wave, you feel that good feeling that comes when you have a bad feeling in a good way, in a skillful way. You actually feel that happening moment by moment. So you're getting your quote reward instantly. I'm sure for many of you beginning your practice, you find it quite a challenge just to sit for a half an hour. You may wonder, you know, how can the teachers sit up here for two hours so seemingly effortlessly? My body hurts after a while if I sit period after period after period. But what happens is that I begin to feel, as soon as the pain arises, I feel the purification arising automatically. So I've been meditating for 20 years. Even after 20 years, if I sit long enough, certainly if I sit for four hours without moving, there's going to be strong pains arising in my body. So then you might say, well, you sat for 20 years, his body still hurts. Yes, but as soon as the pain arises, the purification arises. And that gives us, it makes it relatively easy to be there because you're getting your reward right away. Now to sit for four hours without moving, for those of you that are starting to meditate, may seem like quite a feat. But my teachers can sit for four days without moving. I've met people that have sat for nine days, no sleep, no food, no water, no teeny movement of the body. This is not legends, this is not in old books, these are friends of mine, ordinary human beings. Not a myth in a cave in the Himalayas. People I've lived with, interacted with in the ordinary human ways. You may think that that's absolutely that. Who could possibly do that? You? You could do that with enough time, with enough training. You're not, a person isn't born to it, it's not in their genes, it's just that these people were methodically trained and worked hard for many, many years. Now, lest there be any misunderstanding, the goal of this practice is not feats of endurance. The goal of this practice is to not blow people away by how long you can sit there. I call that meditation by the odometer principle. You know, like how much miles, you know, how long you can sit. We're not trying to see how many miles you can walk on the cushion without moving. But you can imagine that certainly if a person has reached the point where they can sit with a smile on their face for nine days without moving, that that person can die of cancer with a smile on their face. And they can, if a person knows that they can live their life that way, they can also have a smile on their face when somebody cuts them off in traffic or, you know, they fail to get a promotion that they wanted, etc., etc. So, the reason that the person has a smile on their face, even though the body, as you might imagine, is in pretty extreme discomfort, is because that person is moment by moment experiencing purification. And so, they're moment by moment experiencing something of value happening right then and there. No one can sit for hours and hours as an act of faith or an act of grim endurance. No human being can do that. It's beyond the human to sit for nine days, especially without water or sleep. No human being can do that out of faith or endurance or willpower. The only way a human being can do that is if something really good is happening to that person every second that gives that person a reason to fairly effortlessly keep on doing that. So, I only say this so that you understand that after many years of meditation, you still feel physical and emotional pains, but you've trained yourself, or rather you've allowed nature to train you, in a way that there's a very definite silver lining to that, a very definite positive aspect to it, and it utterly changes your perspective on things. One other thing that I want to point out to you, if I talk about somebody sitting for nine days, these are people whose bodies are very limber and are not damaged by that kind of thing. We don't do anything in the Buddhist practice that damages the body. If you have some special condition that is going to be damaged by long sitting, then certainly meditate in a chair, and if need be, you can meditate lying down. Let us know, and we'll provide that for you, because we don't do anything, it's not necessary to do anything to physically damage the body. In fact, it's considered to be unskillful in the Buddhist tradition to do anything that physically damages the body. On the other hand, if we're only talking about subjective sensations, discomforts, see if you can stay with that. You don't want to do anything to objectively hurt the body, but if it's just a matter of subjective sensations, see if you can stay with it. And if it becomes so predominant that you cannot attend to, say, the breath or what your initial object of meditation was, then simply meditate on that physical sensation. Make it the object of meditation. There are a couple of sensations that come up for people that they, people often have questions about. One is your legs fall asleep, if you're not used to the posture. It is not because circulation is cut off. As I understand it, it's actually pressure on nerves. So sometimes slightly shifting the position will help when your legs fall asleep. Otherwise, don't worry about it. The only physical danger to the body and the legs falling asleep is when you get up, you might fall over if you try to walk too quickly. But just the legs being anesthetized for that short period of time, the half hour that we sit or 40 minutes that we sit, isn't going to damage your body. Although I know there's a tendency to think I'm going to be paralyzed for life, you know, gangrene is setting in certainly, you know, I'll never be the same again. This is what psychologists in psychotherapy is called awfulizing. The mind tends to inflate things. So when your legs fall asleep, if you could just sit there with them being asleep, fine. Don't worry about it. The other sensation that people sometimes have is they get a little sick to their stomach or nauseous. Again, it's a subjective sensation. If it becomes predominant, begin to explore it, make it the object of meditation. But don't worry about it. It doesn't mean that anything is wrong. In all my years of teaching meditation, I have never seen anybody actually upchuck in the meditation hall. Okay? So whatever subjective sensations you may have, don't be afraid. It's highly unlikely that it's going to become an objective event, let us say. So it's interesting in the American Indian culture, the sensations associated with being nauseous, I know they're awkward and the last thing in the world you want to stay with. But those sensations are very much used in their ceremonies. They're considered to be part of the purification process. There's certain things that the Indians eat on the East Coast. They had something called the black drink. And nowadays they eat peyote cactus and things like that. And these things will actually make you vomit. And the vomiting is part of the ceremony. It's actually incorporated into the ceremony. And you don't leave the teepee because you're going to vomit. That's part of your purification. And they have equanimity with those sensations. They just accept those sensations being there. And you feel very cleaned out.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.92, "text": " a few words to introduce to you the vipassana practice.
