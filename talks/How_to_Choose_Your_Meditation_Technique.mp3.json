{"text": " A question that is frequently asked is, what technique should I use in my meditation, both in terms of, you know, in the retreats and in my daily sitting? I usually encourage people to do whatever works for them, and for a given person at a given period in their life, it can differ. I don't believe that there is one way or one best way that all people should follow in order to meditate, but I can give you some guidelines that will help you make those decisions. If you look back so far at the techniques that I've introduced to you, they all have one underlying commonality, and that is that one takes an aspect of experience and one infuses it with these twin qualities, mindfulness and equanimity. Mindfulness meaning precision, meaning continuity of contact, meaning clarity. Equanimity meaning an attitude of non-interfering, an openness in the mind and body to allow the flow of consciousness to assume whatever form it wants. Equanimity can be cultivated, we can let go of judgments, we can relax the body, but equanimity also just happens to you if you sit still enough, long enough. And I'm sure many of you have had that experience, it just happens. That's one of the reasons why we sit for all these hours on these retreats, we're waiting for the law of averages to catch up. Everything is impermanent, including our grasping, including our resistance, it's impermanent. So if we sit long enough, still enough, we'll be present at a moment when, just in the course of things, our grasping lessons of its own and we see, oh, our suffering has gone down and our happiness has gone up. And that's an example of equanimity happening to you just as part of a course of nature. But if you were sitting still and really paying attention, you'll be able to be aware of that fact and replicate it. You'll be able to go back to that state. So equanimity can be cultivated, you can let go of tensions and holdings in the body. To a certain extent, you can let go of judgmental thoughts, to a certain extent. And then another way that equanimity is learned is it just happens as you're sitting there. Suddenly you're allowing the process to flow and you're there to learn what that's like. So since the commonality of all of these practices is the mindfulness and the equanimity, from a certain perspective, it really does not matter what technique you practice. It does not matter what object of meditation you use or what procedure you use, as long as you are cultivating those qualities. However, there are a couple of things that you might keep in mind. If you look at the range of techniques that have been presented so far, and there's more or less, there's just a couple more things we're going to present, we're pretty much to the end. They fall under two categories. Some of the procedures are ways of making contact with phenomena. And that's always the first challenge, just to get in contact with what is. Even after 20, 30 years of meditation, if you're facing some big pressure in external life or you're hitting a very deep level of blockage within, you may be very challenged just to keep contact with what is, just to know what part of your experience is ideas and what part of your experience is body sensation, just to have that much contact. So the first challenge is to contact phenomena. If you can contact phenomena with tangibility, you've done quite well. The technique where you are aware of the locations within the body is to contact the phenomenon of feeling. You can do an experiment. If you know that you're going to face something challenging, say you know ahead of time that you're going to go into a situation that is likely to perhaps frighten you, perhaps make you angry, something like that, you know that you're going into a situation that's challenging. Before you go into the situation, see if you can label where the feelings come up in the body or at least be aware of that. And you may find some mild feelings. Then as you get closer and closer to the situation, you'll find that the sensations become more intense, more frequent, feel more of the body, etc. And as you move into the challenging situation, see if you can maintain that kind of contact and when the situation becomes completely challenging. And what you'll find is something very interesting. If you lose contact with the sensations, you'll freak out. You'll actually be overwhelmed by the situation. On the other hand, if you are overwhelmed by the situation, you will find you have lost contact with the sensations. So what that means is that if you don't lose contact with what is, you won't be overwhelmed. So as I say often, the first challenge is just to keep contact. One very simple technique for keeping contact with what is, is to be aware of the body sensations in terms of just noting what's coming up at what location. Then I introduced another technique, which is to sweep through the body. That is another strategy for getting in contact with what is as far as feeling goes. Now those strategies, you can use both of them. You can alternate them. Basically, the relationship between them is that the noting of the locations gives you the large scale picture about feeling in the body. When you sweep through, you can start to pick up more fine scale. It sensitizes, the act of sweeping, the awareness sensitizes. So basically, both of those procedures are simply ways of getting in contact with what is as far as feeling goes, one on a larger scale, the other on a finer scale. So you can alternate those, like doing close up work and then getting an establishment sort of shot. Each has strengths and weaknesses. When you leave this retreat, if you attempt to do the sweeping technique, you may find that you encounter a lot of blankness. And that sometimes is frustrating to people. On retreats where you have high concentration, the sweeping tends to be a little easier to do. Even if you encounter blankness, there's a lot to be said for sweeping, even if you're just sweeping through blankness, because you are sensitizing. So those are really just two different procedures for getting in contact with what is as far as feeling goes. Today, we introduced a broader noting, which involved paying attention to the location of the sensations, but at the same time, also paying attention to the hearing, the seeing, the thoughts, and the other senses, if they should come up, taste and smell. All that is is just an extension. Now you are relating to the whole sensory field. You're learning how to cover that field and get in contact with what is. So you had a sequence of techniques like that that sort of help you get in contact with what is. Then you have some techniques that get you in contact with the movement qualities of what is. In other words, what we call anicca, or impermanence. When I had you label the expanding and contracting as the sensations move through the body, now you're attending to not just the sensations, but their increase or decrease, their essential energy or movement. When you worked with the breath, and you felt the expansiveness of the out-breath, the contractiveness of the in-breath, these are techniques to get you in contact with what we call impermanence. Now when you're sitting, if it is possible to do a technique that gets you in contact with impermanence, then that's a good technique to do. It may not always be possible to do that, though, in which case you can use a technique that simply gets you in contact with the phenomenon as it is. So if you want to decide what you should be doing while you're sitting, if it is possible to meditate on the impermanence, either of just the body sensations or impermanence, eventually we'll be watching the expansion and contraction of all six senses. So you can be aware of that impermanence or the impermanence as it's expressed through the intrinsic quality of the breath, the energies that are in the breath. If when you meditate you are able to have contact with impermanence, then that would be in general where you would put your priority as far as technique goes. But you may not be able to get that kind of contact. You may not be able to get that kind of contact with impermanence. So go to a technique that allows you to just observe the phenomena itself, and you penetrate the phenomenon as a phenomenon. So these are some general guidelines about how to choose your technique. There's a couple things where I think people sort of get stuck with the vipassana practice, and I want to mention them. One is sometimes we have, like a person will have an ongoing theme of a certain part of the body will have a sensation. Every day there's like a pressure in their stomach or there's a band around the head. And every single day when they sit down and meditate, they spend all the time meditating on that particular sensation. And that becomes a theme in the meditation. I don't think that that is terribly productive. You can attend to those kinds of sensations, but you also want to attend more broadly. You don't want to sort of get into a whole thing of, you know, just working in one little piece of the body. It's okay to work on that kind of stuff even every day, but pay attention to broader objects besides just what happens to be sort of a peculiarity of the way the body feels. Another thing that can happen where people get caught up is if you do one of the breath practices where you focus, say, at the nostrils or at the abdomen, you just do that practice as a kind of calming exercise. And you can go year after year after year calming yourself with the breath and not really getting insights or purifications. In theory, if you do a vipassana breath exercise, pure vipassana breath exercise, not the one I was, the expansion and contraction, I'll talk about that in a minute. But if you're simply observing the breath, say, at the nostrils or at the abdomen, which is I will call a pure vipassana, anapana, or mindfulness of breathing, that can be done in two ways. That can either be done primarily as a calming exercise, or it can be done to observe the very, very minutely the sensations so that you begin to see that the sensations are impermanent, the sensations along the sweep of the breath are constantly changing and fluctuate. In which case, you are doing the breath observation as an insight practice. One of the things that I notice a lot is that a lot of people do the breath as a kind of calming practice, and it does give them a little edge on life, but they don't go through really dramatic transformations. Now the breath exercise that I gave you, which involved getting in contact with the contractive aspect on the in and the expansive on the out, that is, of course, as many of you have noticed, a very calming and concentrating exercise. But it is more than that, because it's based on the whole philosophy of impermanence, and by attending to the breath that way, you are also developing an insight. You're getting in contact with the fundamental movement of impermanence. So that particular expansion-contraction breath, that exercise that we've been doing, I think has some advantages to it in that it is sort of equally calming, but at the same time, it won't be a cul-de-sac. It won't just lead you to a certain state of calm and not go any further. It will have aspects of insight and contact with impermanence. Another problem that sometimes develops in the vipassana practice is that one solidifies the sense of a self-meditating. As we're sitting there meditating, we certainly have the sense that there is a self there doing the meditation. Just like as you're sitting here listening to me talk, you have a sense that behind those eyes and between those ears, there's a self. We all have that sense. That sense, as far as I can tell, is produced by ideas and body sensations. Gross and obvious ideas and body sensations, and underlying those subtler ones, and underlying those subtler ones that are arising and changing moment by moment. The idea is to have the qualities of mindfulness and equanimity pervade into that sense of the observer. Even though often vipassana teachers, including myself, will describe the vipassana practice as observing, in point of fact, that is not perhaps a very good description of it. Because if you're observing, there's an observed and an observer. And really what we're doing is infusing the qualities of clarity and openness into the six senses. So that's a little different from observing. The sense of a self doing the observing will eventually be clarified in the two senses of the English word clarify. Clarify means two things in English. Something is clear when it, that which was indistinct becomes distinct. We call that clarified. And that which was opaque becomes transparent. We call that clarified. The ideas and body sensations that moment by moment are giving each one of us the sense I am are very indistinct for most people. They are not clearly discerned in their moment by moment arising and passing. When clarity is brought to that, then that is one meaning of the self being clarified. But interestingly enough, when sufficient clarity is brought to those ideas and body sensations, and you can do it right now as you're listening to me, any sense of a self back there seeing and listening. When sufficient mindfulness and equanimity perfuses the thoughts and feelings, then what happens is the self gets clarified in the second sense of the word. It gets transparent. It loses its opacity. At the same time, it becomes elastic. There's not the congealing. So when people say that they, when we say the English language, I'm self-conscious, and it implies an uncomfortable experience, the reason is because there is a lot of holding and congealing around the ideas and body sensations that moment by moment produce within each one of us the sense I am. That's what makes it an unpleasant experience, not the ideas and body sensations themselves. In fact, they're beautiful. Every self is beautiful. But if you freeze it, which is the general, first of all, most people can't even detect it in terms of specifically ideas and body sensations, images of who you are, attitudes, body outline, all that sort of stuff. Most people can't detect it, and they don't even know that they're moment by moment solidifying and congealing and freezing around that phenomenon. So when that phenomenon becomes clarified, it also becomes, it goes from being rigid to being elastic. So it's real important in this practice not to solidify the sense of self, and not to get that sense of I'm here meditating. Now at the beginning, inevitably, one has that sense, but eventually that has to be seen through. Using the method of expansion and contraction is useful for that, because it tends to give you more a sense of participating rather than observing. If you say rising and falling, there tends to be a self over here watching something rise and fall. If you say expansion and contracting, you're sort of, you are it, rather than you are watching it. And ultimately, what you need to see is that the ideas and body sensations that produce the sense of self vibrate, they expand and contract. And that's when you have the experience of no self or complete self, whatever word you want to use. So that's sort of another thing to be aware of in the vipassana practice. I'd like to talk about a couple phenomena that come up while we're meditating, because a number of people have mentioned these phenomena. And probably a number of you are experiencing them or will experience them. They're interesting phenomena, actually. One is that you have what are called either visions or hallucinations, or the Zen word is makyo. You see things, you hear things. You get a lot of visual type stuff. It can happen with your eyes open, it can happen with your eyes closed. It tends to happen particularly if you have sleep deprivation, if you have, in fact, in general, physical stresses tend to cause this. If you're fasting, if you're going without water, if you have sensory deprivation, if you have sleep deprivation, if you're in extreme cold or extreme heat, extreme pleasure and extreme pain, they tend to cause these types of phenomena. In Japanese, in the Zen temples, they call it makyo, which literally means sort of the realm of the devil. But in Buddhism, ma in Japanese, mara, it's from the Sanskrit mara. But you have to understand what devil means in Buddhism. Devil is not like Satan in the Western religions at all. Devil means something that gets in the way of your spiritual practice, is devil. And so the reason they call it makyo is that it does get in the way of a lot of people's spiritual practice. On the other hand, it constitutes the content of a lot of other people's spiritual practice, which is sort of an interesting thing. What to do if you start to get visionary material or hallucinations? It tends to be in the visual, but it can happen auditory. In fact, indeed, it can happen in all six senses. It's not just a matter of seeing. You can feel. If you really get into these realms, you can touch it. So that thing about, you know, pinch me so I know if it's a dream or not, okay, well, could still be a dream, okay? There are two levels at which this material can be worked on. One is at the level of the content of consciousness. The other is at the level of the nature of consciousness. By and large, there is a very strong tendency if this material comes up, especially if it comes up in the form of gods, goddesses, archetypes, entities, spiritual guides, et cetera, there is a very strong tendency to deal with it at the level of content of consciousness. Nothing wrong with that. But if you only do that, in other words, if you only relate to these things in terms of what they appear to be, then you miss a very, very important opportunity, a very important opportunity. And I would say 99.9% of people that have this material, whether they're freaked out by it or whether they use it for, quote, spiritual practice, fail to understand the true significance of these phenomena and therefore fail to really get from it what they could. In general, people either get freaked out or they get interested and start to relate to it and learn from it. Because you can talk to the gods, you can, you know, have a conversation with the Virgin Mary, and it's real, it's as real as anything. Whether it's actual or not, that this is another issue, OK? But it is certainly real. Or you get freaked out by it. What tends to happen is it tends to appear sometimes in weird and sort of just random forms, but sometimes it can take on the very avatar, the very archetype of craving, aversion, and unconsciousness. So I guess that's why they call it the devil realms, OK? You can have the absolutely, ultimately seductive sexual image for your psyche appear for real in front of you. The perfect woman, or whatever your sexual, you know, for me it would be the perfect woman, OK, physically will appear that could never exist in the material world. And there she is. And you can even touch. It could be that real. Or monsters and stuff like that. You know, it can be a little bit difficult to deal with. Or you just, you see assorted faces, and, you know, it's not always quite so archetypical and dramatic as what I just described. You just see faces and shapes and stuff like that. Anyway, what's the point of all of this? If you remember the canons of vipassana, the basic principles, the axioms, whatever comes up you observe it with mindfulness and equanimity, including the reactions to meditation. If you can be precise and detached and observe that material, then you can get something really wonderful, even more wonderful than talking to a god. In fact, a hundred million times more wonderful than talking to a god. What is happening at that time is that the fundamental creative activity of consciousness is manifesting these forms. It's sort of like a world opening up in miniature. More than a world, like a universe that opens up in miniature. If you observe it carefully, with a lot of equanimity, what you'll begin to see is that underneath those forms are movements of consciousness. And it's like a churning, like a churning of the ocean makes foam. Or when you churn milk, the butter comes up to the surface. There is a churning, which is a pure movement of consciousness that is formless, willless, and effortless. And in the folds, in the interstices of that expansion and contracting movements, these forms are floating up. They're being generated. And the more detached you become from the forms, the more realistic they get, until you become completely detached from them, and they break up into the pure energy of expansion and contraction. What happens then is that you get a very clear insight into how the activity of consciousness, of mind, with a capital M, produces appearances. It's almost like a model or a miniaturized version in a manageable form for what is going on in the macroscopic scale in this scene that we're in here. But this scene is such a huge movement of consciousness and has so much freezing and congealing that only deeply liberated people can see themselves and the scene that they're in being formed by the invisible movements of the formless hands of God, so to speak, or mind with a capital M. But if you observe it in miniature, in these, quote, visions or, quote, hallucinations, and you really are able to penetrate it and really get detached, and it's not easy, because if the archetype of sexual perfection appears, it's not easy to just, you know, to look with the detached eye. But if you do, you find that underneath there is a movement, and that in point of fact, the forms only appear as objects when there is subtle grasping in that movement. Of course, the grasping starts in the unconscious. What's happening when you are with those images is that you are very near the base of consciousness. You're very near the unconscious. You're near where the grasping starts. You're also near where the mind, the source of experience is. And the source of experience is this movement of impermanence, this expansion and contraction. So if you could observe with detachment, you start to see the underlying effortless, formless working or doing that is generating these. And you also see that as soon as there's any hitch or glitch in the unconscious where there's any grasping, that movement solidifies for a moment and becomes a thing. But when there's no grasping whatsoever, the movement doesn't solidify and it becomes pure activity. And then you analogize from that and you realize that the self and the world arise in exactly the same way as these miniature selves and these miniature worlds, that is this so-called visionary material. In other words, when you are having those, quote, hallucinations or, quote, visions or you are, quote, encountering the world of the gods, whatever words you want to use. You know, if you want to give a secular humanist psychological interpretation or if you want to give a theistic interpretation, whatever you want. The point is when that realm manifests, you are very, very close to being able to see how the activity of impermanence forms the self and the world moment by moment. But because the images that are being produced are often so distracting, either in the sense of offering you positive things or in the sense of intimidating you, that it's very difficult to simply observe them as pure movement of consciousness. So this is an example of, and then people get caught in the content of that material. Okay, so they get caught in the content. The reason that we call it makyo or an obstruction is that people get caught in the content and lose the opportunity to understand the contour, to understand the nature of consciousness through keeping the axiom of consistency and consistently observing with mindfulness and equanimity. So that's one phenomenon. Hey, you don't have to get this to get enlightened, okay? But if it should happen to you, perhaps you will remember these things. Another phenomenon that I wanted to just briefly talk about, it may happen as you are meditating that you get in contact with something like very subtle little vibrations. What that is is miniature expansion and contraction, high frequency expansion and contraction. It may also happen as you're sitting sometimes that you get like clear light, like real brilliant light. I know you're sitting there thinking, I never got that clear light. I'd sure like to have some of that light. The light, again, you don't have to have it. Enlightenment does not mean that you've seen light, okay? Not by the wildest stretch of the imagination. In fact, enlightenment means you're comfortable in the dark. That's exactly what enlightenment means. You don't need light anymore. That's exactly what enlightenment means. There's a famous Zen story about blowing out the candle. But anyway, tomorrow night, remind me. Remind me tomorrow night. But anyway, be that as it may. Clear light is very, very high frequency expansion and contraction, very high frequency impermanence. But if you grasp on, it appears as light, but if you let go, it appears as pure vibration. In any event, if it should happen in your meditation, and again, it does not have to happen, it is not a goal, it is not to be sought. If it should happen that you get in contact with very subtle vibrations, some people describe it as being like sparks, some people describe it as being like champagne bubbles, fizzies, okay? That is what we call subtle impermanence, just as the more undulatory movements are the large-scale impermanence. It's something that you can make your object of meditation. Don't make it an object of desire, though, I repeat, or you will destroy the vipassana practice. Just as it's very difficult, these are two difficult things, it's difficult to be with visionary, hallucinatory material with equanimity. It's also difficult to be with those subtle vibrations with equanimity, because usually they're quite pleasant. And you've been suffering so much, you know, with gross unpleasantness, that when it happens, it's like, oh, this is the fountain of youth, this is what I always wanted, this is it, and this has got to last, or I've got to stop meditating. If I can't have this, I don't want... So you want to really be aware of any sort of attitude like that that may arise. Don't look for it, don't seek it, but often, especially towards the end of a ten-day retreat, if you look there, if you look inside, you'll see that a lot of you will be having that subtle vibratory phenomenon. You can make that your object of meditation, you can pay attention to it. Observe it with mindfulness and equanimity. You will find that, by and large, it will make you feel good, it will make you feel peaceful, sort of like another kind of massage. The undulatory stuff is like getting a massage, the vibratory stuff is like a vibrating chair, okay, it sort of relaxes you. It particularly has a tendency to come on during chanting. I don't know if any of you have noticed, but it does, that is a time when it particularly can be there. It also comes on after you've had intense pain with pretty good equanimity. There's another time that it tends to happen. Remember I said that you could either observe phenomena, or you could observe the impermanence of phenomena. If you're aware of large-scale expanding and contracting, that's large-scale impermanence. If you detect that subtle stuff, that's fine-scale impermanence, and you can be with that. There are two things that I would mention to you to know how to use those fine little vibrations so that it really turns into vipassana, rather than just space-out meditation. There are a lot of people that get in contact with some level of subtle vibration, and they sort of abide in it, and it relaxes them, and they have it day after day on a consistent basis, but they don't really grow and change. The reason is because of the way they're relating to that subtle impermanence. Basically it's an attitude of, there's the world out there, and then I can withdraw into this nice inner world of subtle vibrations. I can have some period of feeling really good and refreshed, and then I come out, and then I'm back in the world until my next hit, because that's basically a drug, relating to it as a drug. I know, again, a lot of you are thinking, I wouldn't mind having a drug like that, as opposed to, compared to just sitting there with my legs aching and my mind wandering. I'd sure like to, being drugged by the subtle free flow of impermanence doesn't sound so bad. But again, compared to the potential, the missed potential, both of these things, the thing with the visionary material and the thing with the subtle vibrations, are both examples of missed potentials in the practice. So what's the missed potential with the subtle vibration? What you want to see is that whenever there is an arising of a phenomenon in the field of consciousness, like hearing or seeing or thinking, it causes an activation. When you can observe the correlation between events happening and the level of activation of the subtle vibration, you are setting up a learning situation. We call vipassana practice, it's sometimes called insight meditation, because we want to learn things. In this case, what's being learned? In this case, what's being learned is that it is not the case that there is a material world out there and a thing called a self back here, and then there's those subtle vibrations. What is the actual situation is that whatever part of a phenomenon, be it from the self or from the world, whatever part of a phenomenon is experienced completely, that part of that phenomenon, the complete part of that phenomenon presents itself as those vibrations. In other words, those vibrations are the self and the world. That portion of self or world that at that moment is being experienced completely, that is to say with perfect mindfulness and equanimity, presents itself as that vibration. So let's say you hear a sound, 95% you may have gaps in awareness and you may have congealing around that sound. So 95% that sound will appear as an object called sound separate from you. The 5% of the hearing that is complete will appear as a burst of bubbles in the field of subtle impermanence. I think you can see what would happen if the proportion was reversed. If 95% of the hearing were complete and only 5% was held onto, this would then be enlightened consciousness. So you want to over and over and over again, thousands of times literally, begin to experience the fact that that subtle vibration is what you've been calling the world and is what you've been calling the self. Just this is the part of the self that is complete, the part of the world that is complete. In this way, you don't go in and out of meditation. What happens is that you get an insight so that you understand that everything that you see is the flow of spirit. Is that clear? It's a little hard to put into words. But now perhaps you can begin to get some sense of why I talk about the spiritual path as learning how to be on vacation all the time. It is a fountain of youth. You come to understand that the experience of driving your car on the freeway in the middle of smoggy summer in Los Angeles at rush hour is a fountain of youth, of free-flow, effortless vibration. And it's real. And the neat thing is, because 5% always appears as an object, you don't crash your car. But you can literally be on vacation stuck in a gridlock in LA in the middle of summer on a smoggy day. That's sort of my avatar of a solidified, horrible experience. And that can be just the most blissful, free-flow, whatever, once you realize that everything you hear, see, smell, taste, think, and feel is that flow of spirit. But that realization will never come if you just withdraw into that energy and you don't make the effort to see the correlation between the moment-by-moment upwelling of phenomena and the moment-by-moment activation of the subtle energy. Now I know what I just talked about is only relevant to those of you that are having the phenomenon of this subtle energy. For those of you that are not having the phenomenon, don't worry about it. You don't have to have this phenomenon. All you have to do is keep pervading, keep bringing mindfulness and equanimity to what is. There's a second important aspect about making the subtle vibration a learning experience. Besides the learning that takes place when you correlate it and understand, oh, that is the world. What I've been calling the world is that. The second aspect is when I say that those vibrations are pleasant, I should first of all say some people get discomfort from that energy. But that's not intrinsic to the energy. That's because when the energy comes up, it sort of opens things up. And a lot of it unblocks things, but it also brings up a lot of blockages. But sometimes there's resistance to the flow of those bubbles, and that causes discomfort. But most people experience that subtle energy as intrinsically pleasant. But actually, that's not the point. There's a much more important point. The subtle movements take place without any push or pull, without any cravings or aversions, without any will or desire. They are light and effortless. They are dynamic, but there is no drivenness. Those subtle little bubbles or rapid expansions and contractions are without push and pull. In other words, they are rather like the purity of nirvana. At the macroscopic level, we are creatures of will and desire. We are creatures of push and pull. We are creatures of need and fear. But at the microscopic level, the subtle part of our being is very close to nirvana. It's very pure. It has no will, no desire, no needs, no fears. So when you are able to contact that subtle energy, you can begin to imbibe the qualities of effortlessness that the microscopic level of your being has, imbibe it into the macroscopic level of your being, so that you literally learn to arise as an effortless bubble in the universe. The whole macroscopic being. You're moving, you're talking, even you're thinking. So that just as if you rub up against a wall that is covered with chalk and it's white, the whiteness will rub off on you. When you rub up, you make some contact with those effortless movements within, their effortlessness will start to rub off on you and inform your being. And they will teach you. They will literally teach you ten times a second. They will teach by example. Each one of them, each little vibration, because it has no push and pull, can tell the parts of you that are creatures of push and pull how to become free or be free from push and pull. So it's actually, people talk about an inner teacher, an inner guide, they usually mean some sort of archetype that they have conversations with. But the real inner teacher is actually nature itself, that there's a sermon going on in the core of your being at the frequency of maybe 30 cycles per second. And it's incredibly rapid teaching and it goes on all the time. So that you can begin to imbibe those qualities into your larger being. And parts of you that are solidified in mind and body, when they rub up against that subtle impermanence, can be taught directly by the subtle impermanence how not to be solidified. It's a teaching that is, I mean to say it's pre-verbal is, you know, it's way beyond pre-verbal. It's primordial. And your job as meditator is to merely be the intermediary that gets this subtle teacher in contact with the gross solidified student. And then it does its work within you, purifies you. This is why they talk about activating impermanence as being this purifying activity. And why they speak of, although impermanence seems like a negative concept, it has some very, very positive qualities to it as an actual spiritual practice. So just to reiterate, if it should happen that you encounter this subtle vibratory phenomena, try to remember two things that will make it a learning experience for you rather than just a pleasant, interesting, you know, thing that happened. The first is to watch how that field is in fact correlated with the rising of events in consciousness. And the second is to use it as a sort of teacher, because they are pure, quote pure. They will teach you how to be purified. They will purify you. And so it will be a transformation of consciousness. I should say, when I speak of subtle impermanence, some of you of course have experienced this. Some of you are probably thinking this is pretty esoteric. I don't think I'll ever have an experience like that, etc., etc. But it's not that esoteric. When people run or lift weights, they get the runners high, they get the pump. You take a cold shower in the morning, you feel invigorated. If you sit down and meditate and really pay attention to the way your body feels, if you've got runners high, or even something as seemingly banal as that invigorated feeling after a real cold shower, if you sit down and pay attention, you'll see little vibrations everywhere. It's something most people have experienced. They just don't understand the significance of it and how it can be used for really, really deep transformation.
