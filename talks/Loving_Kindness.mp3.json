{"text": " Sometimes people ask me, what's meditation ultimately for? What's the purpose of all this that we do, that we sit on these cushions and go through all of these different things? And my standard answer is that the reason that we sit on the cushions and go through these various disciplined practices is so that we may pass through a sequence of accelerated growth experiences. And that sequence of accelerated growth experiences culminates someplace. And the place that it culminates is what is referred to sometimes as loving kindness, sometimes as compassion. These are very related things. In the Theravada tradition, often they will use a little more often the word loving kindness. In the Mahayana tradition, a little more often they use the word compassion. But these are very interrelated things. In other words, although the meditation appears to be a going in, its culmination is in fact a radical going out. In a way that one becomes an effortless source of strength and goodwill to the people around one. So if somebody were to ask me what is the ultimate goal of meditation or where does it culminate, I would say that is where it culminates. And I would choose those words carefully. The key aspect is that it is effortless. We all know the sort of compassion or do-gooding type of thing which involves effort, which involves struggle. And although that has value, the purpose for having passed through the different meditative experiences is that the love and goodwill that begins to radiate from the person is consistent and effortless and just happens. It's just with them all the time. So that there is a sort of beneficent influence that spreads from that person and at different levels impacts all of the people around them, everybody that they come into contact with. I've heard it said that the meditative path starts by learning how to keep your back straight. After you keep your back straight, of course, your body can settle. When the body settles, the breath settles. When the breath settles, the mind will settle. When the mind settles, you can begin to have insights. When you get deep insights, insights that allow for the purification, the release of the accumulated poison and pain of a lifetime. And as that material comes to the surface and literally boils off, the innate purity of the mind is revealed. And that innate purity of the mind can take the coloring of love and goodwill just as a cloth that's white can easily take dye. And every aspect of one's being simply becomes colored and pervaded with an effortless sense of love and goodwill. And that's where the path culminates. So that in one's day-to-day interactions, when just going around talking to people, even hassling with people. I had a hassle with somebody just before I came to give this talk to you. It was hassling, haggling over prices for a retreat location. They wanted too much, we wanted to pay less. And it's real because it means the difference of $1,000 on one side or the other. How do you hassle with somebody? It is possible to hassle and have real issues going on and still have an underlying coloration of love and goodwill that is there. That's what I mean by effortless and continuous or habitual. So you could say in a very abbreviated form that the path begins by learning to keep your back straight and culminates by being an effortless source of love and strength and goodwill to the people around you. And of course in between, many, many, many extraordinary experiences have to be passed through, which are called the aspect of purification. In the Mahayana tradition, the purification or wisdom aspect, sometimes the word insight is used, but sometimes you'll see that they'll translate the word as wisdom in English. It doesn't mean the ordinary sense of wisdom, like you're a wise old man necessarily. It means wisdom in the sense of purifying insight. In any event, in the Mahayana tradition, wisdom is put on a par with compassion. And these are said to be sort of like the two aspects of the path. And there are many, many interesting symbolisms. For example, when you get involved in the Vajrayana school, they'll even use sexual symbolism in their icons, their religious images, to express the absolute unity of these two aspects of the practice. And some of you may know, like in the Vajrayana rituals, you hold a bell and you hold an object that's called a vajra. And those stand for the compassion and wisdom aspects also. So they like those polar symbols. And to understand the interrelationship between the aspect of the purification and release and insight on one hand, and the aspect of reaching out in a compassionate, loving way on the other hand, this is a very, very important thing to know about. Usually my talks tend to center on the aspect of the wisdom and purification, but today I'd like to emphasize a little bit about the loving kindness or compassion aspect. Just as there are techniques or procedures for developing insight, you go step by step, you do this, you do this, you do this, there are also strategies for developing the loving kindness and compassion. And I'd like to share a few strategies, a few of those strategies with you. You may not want to do it exactly this way, but it may give you some sort of indication or hint of a direction to go. One thing that I think is useful to keep in mind, and perhaps you won't believe this, but it seems to me to be true, is that our natural state, the natural state of mind, is a state that is beneficent. That is to say, it has an aspect of goodwill that is universal. If it were not for the layers and layers of subliminal pain, you all understand what I mean by subliminal, unconscious, semi-conscious. If it were not for the layers and layers of semi-conscious pain that cover over our true mind, I think that every human being would be in contact with this effortless beneficence or goodwill towards others. I don't know if you can remember, but I can remember when I was young, it wasn't enough that I should be happy. It's like I felt I would never be happy unless everybody around me would be happy too. Does anybody remember anything like that? I wonder if other people had that when you were little. It's like, of course, my world wasn't very big. It was like my parents, my grandmother, you know, a few. I had a teeny little world, but I wanted everybody in that, you know, my pet, right? It's like my teddy bear, which I was talking about at a very young age, right? I wanted all of these beings that were in my world to be happy. It seems to me that that is really our native state, that we want to have the whole environment be happy. And you may know that there is this saying, sabbe sattva sukhi ho tu. Maybe you haven't heard it in the Pali, but it means, may all beings be happy. Sukhi ho tu is the Buddhist greeting. Did you know that? That is the original Buddhist greeting, whereas in some traditions they may say, God, or they say, God bless you or something like that. In Buddhism, they say, be happy. Sukhi ho tu. That's when people go like this in the Theravada world, the original Buddhist world, they're saying, sukhi ho tu, be happy. So it's sort of like, that's really our native state. It gets covered over by subliminal discomforts. And when you're sitting in meditation and your mind's wandering and your body's fidgety and all sorts of yuck is coming up, that's that pain that is ordinarily semi-conscious is coming up to full consciousness. And well did it come up. It has to be worked off in that way. But it gradually, gradually gets worked off. So what we're talking about in a sense, even though we talk about cultivating love and goodwill and compassion, in point of fact, another way to look at it is that we're merely revealing something that has always been there. How to go about cultivating it or developing it or revealing it? One way is to go in your mind and make a sequence of affirmations. And this is a technique that's done and sometimes it's done at the end of retreats. And with those affirmations you do visualization. So you say, you know, may all beings be happy. You start out, may I be happy. And you visualize yourself being happy and good energy coming to yourself. And then say, okay, may my friends be happy and you visualize that going out to them. And you do a mental affirmation and a visualization like that. And this brings about some of that state of friendliness. This is one practice and it can be very nice if somebody leads you through it. And I think there may even be such tapes available. Another approach which is not entirely separate but just has a little different emphasis is the one that I like to use a lot, which involves first, as much as possible, experiencing your body as sort of porous energy. Now I'm quite aware that it's not always possible to do this. But for example, at an end of a retreat or after an end of sitting, it sometimes happens that you can have some insight into the impermanent or wave qualities of your body sensations. And some of you may have even had the experience sometimes of experiencing your body and in fact all of your senses as very subtle little vibrating waves. Now to have that experience, either to experience larger, sort of slower patterns of change, or to experience those subtle vibrating little waves in all of your sense doors. To have that kind of experience, of course, is insight. That's liberating. It's experiencing that part of you which is functioning effortlessly as just a flow of nature, the way ripples effortlessly spread over the surface of a lake. If you have had that experience, either at a deep level or at any level whatsoever, it means that your body and indeed all of your senses are beginning to become somewhat porous, a little bit like a sponge. Now a sponge can just soak things up, right? You put a drop of water on a sponge and it just pervades the whole body of the sponge. For a person that has developed, and this shows you some of the relationship that I said, the relationship between wisdom and love and compassion. If you've had the wisdom or insight to experience your body and indeed any of the senses in terms of their essential vibratory nature, you can then use that insight to develop or spread the loving kindness. If you remember my remark about goodwill is our native state or our natural state, you can sort of see it come out in just our day-to-day social interactions. In a little while I'll be done talking. We'll go and we'll be having our bagel brunch. And what will you be doing? We'll be talking to each other. And as we'll be talking to each other, won't we be smiling a lot of the time? We'll be enjoying that. We'll be expressing in some way our human feelings of happiness to be with each other and happiness to be in this situation. That little smile or the little warm feeling, the little pleasant sensation that comes up for you in ordinary social interactions, that can be the seed for loving kindness. It's just natural. It's just sort of there. You meet somebody, you smile and whatever. There is a felt sense of goodwill at that time. We're happy to see our friends. We're happy to be with people. That is to say there is identifiable, detectable, pleasant body sensation. Your smile feels good. True or false? How many of you have ever felt your smile as a body sensation? Somebody's smiling now. Okay, now more people are smiling. It feels good, doesn't it? Isn't it a pleasant body sensation? And it is a body sensation that is somewhat associated with goodwill. That's why in the Tibetan tradition, when you meditate, you're sometimes instructed that you should have just the subtlest smile on your face as you're meditating. And when you do that, you discover that just making that little smile as you sit puts a subtle bliss through your whole body, which can make it very easy to sit, actually. Sort of the opposite of Zen sitting, which is, in Zen you're supposed to look like a samurai. But in the Tibetan you have to have a little bit of a smile. Okay, now if you have had some experience of the porosity of your sense doors, especially your body sense, you can take that little bit of felt goodwill and let your body just absorb it like a sponge. And it can spread because the body is porous. Not only is the body porous, but you're sensing movement, vibration. And that movement can become modulated, literally modulated, with the feeling tone of love and goodwill. And this is my own favorite technique. And as I say, everybody has their own techniques, and I would never say this is the way to meditate or whatever. What I'm telling you now is more along the lines of sharing what I like to do, what I'm in fact doing right now as I'm talking to you, to whatever extent I can. As I look at each one of your faces, I feel some good feeling. I know most of you, and it's like I'm happy you're here. And I feel blessed to be able to do the work that I do. And here you are. There's some seeds of good feeling. It's subtle. I feel a little warm feeling here, a little smiley feeling there. And as soon as that arises, I let it get picked up by all the vibrations in my body. And just as a little drop of food coloring, when you drop it into a clear glass of water, it pervades all the water. In a sense, it doesn't literally magnify, but in a sense it seems to magnify. It spreads. In the same way, any aspect of movement or impermanence can literally take up that feeling tone and spread it and broadcast it. You know how the TV and radio works? It's called modulation. There's a carrier wave, and then that carrier wave has superimposed on it a very subtle modulation, either of frequency or of amplitude. And it starts to carry a message, and it broadcasts it out, literally. Well, as your insight grows, you begin to experience solid objects like your body or the room as waves. Now, if you haven't done much meditation, that may seem pretty far out. But just think in terms of physics. Matter is very much related to wave functions. Every piece of matter has a wave function associated with it, according to physics. We actually see something like that in our meditation. Now, that means that to whatever extent you can experience your body, your thoughts, your vision as wave, to that extent, it's relatively easy to begin to modulate it with a sense of, or a coloration of love and goodwill. And it starts to broadcast out. It's very much along the lines of the analogy of TV and radio broadcasting. So that all, not all, but let's say some, to a certain extent, you're experiencing the world in terms of vibration or movement. And whenever you're aware of those vibrations, you take whatever little bit of felt goodwill that you have at that moment, and you let those vibrations pick it up and start to broadcast it out. And it first just fills your whole body, and then it starts to fill larger spaces, you might say. It can go out almost like a cloud outside of you and carry out into the world around you. Well, anyway, you come to a subjective experience of that. If you can get to those very subtle vibrations, those will pick up your loving kindness effortlessly. I mean, just like instantly, and they'll just start to bubble. People ask, you know, might ask, gee, emptiness, emptiness sounds so negative and pessimistic. You know, you Buddhists talk about emptiness, but they don't realize that emptiness is bubbling. It's a bubbly, bouncy, vital, dynamic activity. And that subtle, bubbly substrate of experience will instantly take up the coloration of love and goodwill. And you just start to like bubble with that at the core of your being. So this is another technique for developing it, and it's not contrary to the first technique. They sort of are just looking at the same experience from a different point of view, whether you use mental affirmations and visualization, or whether you try to get down into the actual vibratory nature and modulate that, or whether you do the two together. There's lots of different ways of doing this practice. Ultimately, one develops the boundless love. There are in Buddhism what they call the four immeasurables. Have any of you ever heard of that, or the four boundless? You never heard of that? Okay. These are four very positive states of mind that can become boundless in the sense that literally the world disappears and there is only these states of consciousness. And one enters into the jhana state, so the very, very deep states of concentration, through one of these four immeasurable positive qualities to the mind. There are other ways to enter the jhana state, but this is one way to do it. There are immeasurable loving-kindness, immeasurable compassion, immeasurable sympathetic joy, and I'll explain what that means in a minute, and immeasurable equanimity. They're all very linked together. The loving-kindness is the feeling tone of wanting people to be happy. Actually, even though we translate it as loving-kindness in English, the Pali is metta and the Sanskrit is maitri. And it comes, if you look at the Sanskrit, you can see it comes from the Sanskrit word mitra. I don't know if any of you know what mitra means in Sanskrit. It means friend. One of the Persian gods was named the friendly god, mitra. That's the Persian form of the word, because Persian and Sanskrit are related. That's sort of an interesting little linguistic side-light. But anyway, mitra means friend. And maitri is really friendliness. It's sort of wanting people to be joyful and happy. It's the friendly feeling. That's why I say you can use your friendly feelings that come up in social circumstances. If you magnify them, consciously magnify them, you can develop this maitri. Karuna is compassion. That is to say, you're willing to feel the pain of others. And you're willing to sort of take it on yourself and you want them to be free from their pain. So you're willing to be with others in their pain. Not in a sense that you're caught in that pain, of course, but in a sense that you provide by your willingness to feel their pain in a liberated way, which is 100% willingness to feel it, you provide a model for them to come out of their own suffering. So that's karuna. Anumodana is the Pali word that is sometimes translated as sympathetic joy, which has no meaning at all in English. How is that different from loving kindness? The difficulty is we don't have an English word for this concept. It's basically taking joy in the success of others, especially the spiritual success of others, taking joy in that. It's when you see others that are growing on the path or whatever, to feel joy at that. It may seem very bizarre, but funny things can happen the way the impurities work their way out in us. For example, sometimes when you start your spiritual practice, you might be caught in material materialism. It's like you don't want people to be as successful as you are. Have you ever heard somebody say, it's not enough that I be successful, all my friends have to fail? You know, that kind of emotion, right? And there's a certain tendency within us to work on what's called mana or comparison. Mana doesn't mean pride, it means comparison. It's our measuring, literally. It's our habit of measuring ourselves against each other. So we all know what material materialism is. And we may also know what schadenfroh is. I don't know if any of you know what that word means. Any of you know what that is? Anyone know German? Schadenfroh is taking joy in other people's suffering and in other people's failures. Anybody feel uncomfortable when I said that? We all do it, don't we? I do. Does anybody else here do? Or are we all in a state of denial? Sometimes it might be interesting for you as an experiment, when you hear somebody talk about or gossip about somebody else's problems, to see what kind of sensations come up in the body. I think you'll have to admit there are pleasant ones there. I think one of the quickest ways of breaking this habit of schadenfroh is to actually start to feel just how much pleasure we get when we see somebody else screw up or get fouled up in some way or get screwed in some way. It's like to really acknowledge that that habit is there, and then to start to get specific with it, like to actually feel the subtle little rivulets of pleasure that you may be getting in your chest or your stomach as you hear about somebody you don't like failing or something like that. It's a very interesting meditation to watch that and to really acknowledge the specific pleasures that are coming up in the body. That's why body sensation can be very powerful. And it breaks the habit pretty quickly, once you realize how intense the pleasure is. You don't want to get involved in that anymore so much. And that's when the habit of gossiping and the habit of enjoying other people failing starts to diminish a little. At least that was my experience. I noticed a very, very strong diminishing of that habit. It's obviously not gone by any means, but there was like a quantum drop in my habit of gossiping and listening to others, talking about others, when I really started to scan my body and notice what was going on and just how much pleasure was really there and how much addiction to that pleasure was there. Anyway, the modana or anumodana is the opposite of that emotion. It is the allopathic cure for that. It takes you in the opposite direction. Now, I mentioned about the, we all know about in the material materialism, there's also spiritual materialism that comes up. You can start to want to be the only enlightened person. You think I'm joking, but these are subtle impurities that come up. When those spiritual jealousies come up, they represent a block to the path. So the third of the immeasurable states is you cultivate a state of really taking joy in general in people's success, but specifically in their spiritual success. And you think about the people that are coming along in their meditation and people are getting enlightenment and may that happen and may people make merit and all that kind of thing. Then the fourth of the immeasurables is called upekkha, which is usually translated as equanimity. That is a state of what we might call absolute acceptance. Can you see that that's needed to balance the first three? Because the first three are really aspirations that you're putting out and energy that you're putting out to make the universe a better place. The loving kindness, the compassion, the quote, sympathetic joy in the success of others. Unless all of that energy is balanced by you having a bottom line state of detachment, you might come to some difficulties because you can... Well, let me put it this way. I have been attempting with some consistency to vibrate loving kindness towards President Reagan for some time now, but he's still doing things that make me terrified and humiliated and feel impotent. So there's got to be some detachment that balances this all out. And that's the equanimity. So this is a way of using the insight aspect, the insight into impermanence, to actually spread and magnify and modulate the vibrations of love and goodwill. Now, especially if you can detect the very subtle vibrations. Now, this is something that if you haven't detected it, don't worry about it, because the quickest way to detect it is to not try. As soon as you're trying to see something, for sure you're not going to be able to see it. As they say in Zen, as soon as you turn towards it, you've turned away from it. It's just something that does happen to people as they meditate. There's a sort of baseline flicker of reality that's like a mass of scintillating bubbles. And it is in fact the nature of experience itself. Experience is thousands and thousands or trillions of what they call atta kalapas, little vibrating effortless little events. It's very similar to what the physicists describe as the sea of virtual particles that come into existence and pass away virtually instantaneously. That's what the universe is, the baseline. Most of the activity of the universe is that, the vacuum fluctuations. It's amazing the physicists' words, how they sound like pure Buddhism, right? You know, impermanent emptiness. These are the words they use to describe the so-called material universe. So with any of these four or combinations thereof, you can reach the immeasurable state, the infinite state. How to say this in a way that it doesn't cause problems? If one describes certain states of meditation, and if a person hasn't experienced those, then immediately a big block is put up, like when am I going to experience it or why can't I experience it? So it's very dangerous to talk about, really, states of meditation. But on the other hand, if you don't talk about them, people won't know directions to go. So it's immeasurable when there's nothing but that. Usually you open your eyes and there's a room, and there's people, and you look back, there's thoughts, and there's a body. However, as you begin to experience the impermanent nature or vibratory nature of things, it is possible sometimes to open your eyes and there's, to a certain extent, there's not a room. There is energy or movement or impermanence. And you can color that with one of these positive attributes of mind. And you talk about, people say Christianity is a religion of love, and that's true, actually, it's very true. But the pinnacle of love is where literally the world turns into love. I mean literally. Eyes open, and there's... I mean ice cream trucks are love, are vibrating loving kindness. The ghetto blasters are vibrating loving kindness. The cushions are vibrating loving kindness. It's like literally there's nothing but that. Well that could be called the pinnacle of the experience of love. And that is the meditation of immeasurable love. And with that then one enters into realms that are outside of ordinary appearances. One just literally replaces ordinary appearance with the feeling tone of love. And needless to say this is a very, very exalted and purifying and transforming state to dwell in from time to time. And better still, it's a state that one can, to a certain extent, carry with one into one's social interactions. So that it begins to seem as though the whole world is love. As you're doing that, you are purifying the world around you. And some of you may have heard the expression, how many of you have ever heard the expression pure land? You can raise your hands. Pure land is sort of like a Buddhist concept of heaven. It's a Mahayana concept primarily. It is said that certain individuals called bodhisattvas create around them pure lands. Of course, a person that practices with an understanding that wisdom and compassion or insight and loving kindness are intimately linked, and who practices both equally, that person is called a bodhisattva. As that person begins to live their life, the world around them changes. It changes for them subjectively. In other words, it seems like they're in paradise. But it also changes objectively, in that there is an objective, observable effect on the people around them. Primarily because of this ability to generate the loving kindness all the time. In other words, one needs to be able to get the loving kindness down into the mechanical parts of one's being, the primitive, natural parts of one's being. Because you can't maintain loving thoughts all the time. Because you have to have other thoughts sometimes. And even if you're maintaining a lot of loving thoughts, there's still all the other senses operating. What we want to do is get the feeling tone of love and goodwill to actually percolate down right into the synapses. So that whenever vision is processed, whenever thought arises, whenever a body sensation arises, it will be somewhat colored by that quality of love and goodwill. That's what I meant by being an effortless and continuous source of beneficence for one's environment. I think I have come to the end of what I wanted to say about this. And I would invite any comments or questions. I guess we, yes, good, we have plenty of time. If anybody would like to share their own experiences or ask anything, please feel free to do so. Yes, go ahead. What Shunshin just mentioned about someone who has cultivated loving kindness for a long time or has attained the state of jhana in that certain qualities of his being have been transformed and create a certain aura about him. In the Buddhist text, the Buddha mentioned the eleven qualities that the person who is in loving kindness absorption or practices that daily starts to create. And just a few of them are, he said that he can never be harmed by swords or poisons or any kind of weapons. He's not haunted by demons. He sleeps peacefully. He's not disturbed by bad dreams. The gods love him. And various similar kind of things. So in effect, it's kind of an aura or a shield because one's whole energy right down to the very, you know, cells themselves have been transformed in the very pure energy. You've all heard of course of the Korean photography and the bodies, the prana and the body energy. So it's actually affecting this electrical energy of the body that actually creates a protective shield about him. That's why the Buddha, when there's a story in the Buddhist text that there was somebody jealous of the Buddha and wanted to kill him. So he got an elephant drunk and the Buddha was walking down the road in a village one day on his begging ground. And this man sent the elephant toward the Buddha stomping and twirling his trunk. And the elephant was drunk and he was charging up to the Buddha. And everybody in the village was, you know, scared and begged the Buddha to go off the road. And Buddha just kept on walking. And the elephant stopped just in front of him because he hit this kind of aura shield and immediately stopped and got down on his knees and put his trunk on the Buddha's feet, you know. Just because of that power of his loving kindness. So that's a kind of an example of what kind of transformation goes with a person who is constantly absorbed in loving kindness. Thank you. That's a great story. Your skin and bright eyes too. Children and dogs love you. You've read the list. I didn't know about this list. Yes? I had an experience last week in which I was talking in front of a group and all of a sudden I, well it wasn't all of a sudden, but I started to feel sort of feelings of inferiority. And kind of like a tension, a self-conscious tension. And it stayed with me for, I don't know, for the rest of the day anyway. And I was wondering, in something like that, would it be better to try a visualization, sort of like a fantasy type of thing, to counteract it or to just stay with it? Did everybody hear that, the question? Or just stay with it and try to somehow come to terms with those feelings of fundamentality or something. Right. The question in essence is, if a negativity arises, what strategy should we use to deal with it? Should we try to replace it, a sort of allopathic approach, you sort of replace it with something that's positive? Or should we simply observe its nature? And I would say that both of these strategies are practiced in Buddhism and you can see it in the texts. And therefore they're both valid. But to speak from my own experience, just my own proclivities, I would say that if you have a technique and a skill at vipassana, the technique of observing a negativity, that that is often preferable to simply replacing it with something positive. My feeling is that when you replace it with something positive, you weaken it and you take care of that specific circumstance. But you haven't really uprooted it. It is the dispassionate, systematic observation that uproots the negativity so that its influence in the future is extirpated, it's taken away. So if you know how to do the observation skill, that is preferable from my perspective. Now if you don't know how to do that, then at least do what you can. Often you'll see people develop a difficulty where as soon as something negative comes up, they scramble like crazy to get something positive, to push it away and replace it. And what that's going to do is, that's not going to... That's an interim, what would the phrase be, intermediate... It's not a radical cure, it's a symptomatic, it's a palliation of symptoms, not a cure of the disease. But it will weaken the disease somewhat, so therefore we can't say it's bad, or would never discourage somebody from doing it, because the Buddha himself taught it. He would say, you know, if you have anger, try to replace it with loving kindness. But he also taught how to just observe anger, and that for me, I prefer doing the latter, for several reasons. First of all, the skill at observing can grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow. Whereas the skill at replacing has a very definite limit. There are certain negativities that are just so overwhelming that there's no way that you're going to superimpose some positive tone on top of it. But vipassana can reach any level of strength. That is to say, there's no negativity so overwhelming that you can't see through it with observation. So because the potential for growth is there, and because ultimately the observation is boundless, whereas the replacement is limited, for those reasons I usually encourage people to just observe, if they know how to do that. But of course that's a certain skill that has to be developed. Well, one thing I noticed is that when I was meditating later, I usually when I meditate, I meditate on a feeling. And that feeling I could hit during the meditation. I didn't have to, but I just experienced it real profoundly, and so I could. And I was kind of wondering to myself, is there any value going back to that feeling and just staying with it? That's another interesting question. When you're sitting there and meditating, should you purposefully evoke an issue of your life in order to look at it? And that's a very interesting question, and I don't have a set answer to that. I would simply point out some parameters. The important one being that ultimately, if you're doing a vipassana kind of practice or a choiceless awareness kind of practice, you don't want to be manipulating the internal realm too much, or you're somewhat violating your axiom of choicelessness. Okay, so sometimes I'll do what you just described. I will purposefully think about a situation or even fantasize a situation that I know is going to produce a certain feeling tone within me. And then I'll start to look at it. But the one thing that one has to be careful of is that that not become habit-forming, and that you start to just do that all the time, and you're not willing to just sit there and feel the touch of your clothes or watch your breath or something like that. You have to have something dramatic and, quote, significant going on. So the only danger, I would say occasionally to do that may be productive, but there is a danger that it then becomes habit-forming, and you become uninterested in looking at, quote, ordinary things. Because ultimately, you have to reach the point, as the Zen master Rinzai said, it's amazing from the Zen tradition, it sounds so much like vipassana, but he said something along the lines that you have to reach the point where every time you tie your shoelaces or button your shirt, you work off 500 lifetimes of karma. In other words, those ordinary things are very significant also. So you don't want to become too one-sided that you have to constantly be bringing up something that's, quote, significant. That's all I would say about that. I wouldn't answer yay or nay in general. You asked two very good questions, though, or brought up two very good issues. Anything else anybody would like to... Rick? Yeah, I recently had some puzzling experiences with this. I went to New York City on a business trip, and I had to do some commercial business and a little bit of, I guess, dharma business. And in the middle of it, these meditative states would generate like I'd be doing business with someone. And it was kind of like banana peel city. You know what I mean? You couldn't fixate anywhere? You're always sliding off? Yeah, it was a little bit of that, and I was managing to do it, but it was strange. In other words, how do you function when the earth's shaking under you? It even happened in this Buddhist business that I had to attend to, where it would generate also states in the people around, but it was like a little bit of like they would be on a banana peel, which in that context was a little bit uncomfortable. So how do you... it seems like a strange... Right. What Rick is asking about is a pretty important thing to know about for any of you that are on a, let's say, a life course for the spiritual path. You notice that you were able to function in spite of the fact that it sort of seemed like the world was coming apart. The functionality was still there. It's just that the substantiality was starting to sort of deteriorate. Would that be a fair thing to say? Okay. There are many, many ways that we can look at the experience of enlightenment. Now we're going to talk about enlightenment, the real stuff, the big guns, what it's all about. Many, many ways that we can look at it. I'm going to just give you one perspective on it. One perspective on it is that it's a sequence of acclimations to progressively more ethereal mode of being. Now let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, what does acclimation mean? Do you know what it means to acclimate to an environment? Adjust. You adjust. Yeah, that's a very... right, adjust. For example, you go up on a high mountain and at first you may feel short of breath until your body acclimates to it. And then you don't feel short of breath at all. An example I like to give because it's an even more complete metaphor is what the phenomenon that is called getting your sea legs. Do any of you know what this means? My father was a sailor. Maybe this phrase is not known in general. It's known what this is. If you have not traveled in ships, you've only been on land, the first couple of days aboard a ship or a boat can be very disorienting because there's no solid ground under you anymore. It's constant shifting and movement. That's why it's a more complete metaphor. And in order to drink a cup of coffee, you have to hold on to the railings and really pay attention. You can just barely do it because the earth is shifting. And then after a few days, you just acclimate to that. And you find that you don't even notice it in a sense, even though you would notice it as soon as anybody called your attention, but it doesn't interfere with your functionality. So we could say that you acclimated to that unfixated way of being. Well, that's all that's involved in meditation. As you meditate, more and more you come to realize that the so-called subjective experience of the material world, whatever the world is to a scientist, to a physicist, whatever materiality may be, to a philosopher or a scientist, our subjective experience of materiality is just microscopic tensions. We all know about macroscopic tensions. Everybody's in a favor of sort of relaxing your muscles and all that. But that's just surface. Even what people call deep relaxation is just surface relaxation compared to meditation. In meditation, you start to relax the optic nerve. And what happens is you realize that your sense of a solid world being out there separate from yourself is only a function of subtle tensions. And there's no need to maintain those tensions at all. In fact, they get in the way. They're friction. They use up energy. They are the source of a lot of problems. So you start to let go of them. The world gets unfixated. You start to go from somethingness, that is to say, particulate-ness, to wave. It's the old wave particle thing, except you're going from particle to wave. So as that happens, it happens in stages. And your mind and body acclimate to functioning at each step. And it just takes a little while. The whole trick is just don't freak out and wait for the acclimation to take place, which it will naturally. Just like the person that goes on the ship doesn't have to freak out because now they're in a completely new environment. All my life I've had solid ground under me. Now I don't. All your life, you've had microscopic tensions that have been holding open the world of time and space, rigid. And now your deep mind is starting to realize that not only does it not need those, it's desirable to relinquish them. Therefore, the rigidity of time and space, the sense of separation of self and other, and in general, the solidity of things is beginning to melt. You'll just acclimate to it if you don't freak out too much. And it will be a sequence. You're just starting. It's a sequence of acclimations. Sometimes after a retreat you feel spaced out and whatever. All that is is that latency period for you to acclimate to the next state, or acclimate to your present state, you might say, of unfixatedness. Once you acclimate, just like the person could drink the coffee without having to hold on to the railing anymore, it won't be an effort anymore. I mean, you'll be talking and everything will be going fine. And it may be rather long periods of time between knowing who you are, where you are, but the words are coming out just fine, better than before. And you learn to trust that process. It's called riding backwards on the ox, if any of you know the Zen metaphor. You give yourself to the flow of impermanence. You're riding backwards. You don't need to know where you go anymore. You trust that ox. And boy, it's powerful and direct, and it does the work for you just fine. You can organize a very complicated business deal, and it just sort of happens. You do it the way God does it. It just organizes itself, self-organizing. Okay? So the trick is to realize that all you're doing, it's just a natural process of acclimation to a more ethereal mode of being. Ethereal means spiritized, okay? Less substantial. If you start to freak out, thinking, oh my God, everything's falling apart. There's nothing to hold on to. That's a thought. Don't hold on to it. Let it fall apart. And with that, if you get body sensations of fear or whatever, I'm just vibrating in a void here. And if fear comes because of the fact that you feel, I'm just vibrating in a void, let that fear just vibrate as the void. So if any reactions come up to the fact that the world is starting to disintegrate, of course it's not really, but your solidified internal world is beginning to disintegrate, if reactions come up, be sure to let them disintegrate. So you recycle them into the thing, and you acclimate. If you take somebody, like if there's somebody here that has never, ever meditated, maybe there might be somebody here that's never meditated, I don't know, and let us say that you decide, okay, I'm going to be a meditator, and you're going to meditate for the next 15 years. If I had a time machine right now, and I could take you as you are now, and thrust you into the subjective state, or your ordinary state that you'd have after 15 or 20 years of meditation, but bypass all those acclimations, you would physically faint. You'd just faint. Your body and mind would not be used to that mode of being. It would be so, I hate to use the word dead, but it would be so, shall we say, spiritized, that in all likelihood you could not maintain consciousness. You'd just sort of go. Now, we're talking about the day-to-day state that you're going to have after 20 years or 30 years of meditation. Now obviously, 20-year, 30-year meditators are not spending their day in a swoon. They're very effective people. They can be very, very forceful. It's just that they've acclimated to it over a fairly long period of time. So they're acting in a place that's well beyond the pass-out place. So you're getting your first experience, and everybody has to pass through it, and it's the same for everybody. But the thing is, you realize the function just happened. It happened in spite of the fact that the substance was lacking. That's what this path is. It's going from being substance to function. Does that put it within a context? Okay, very good. I think that's probably pretty good for today.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " Sometimes people ask me, what's meditation ultimately for?
