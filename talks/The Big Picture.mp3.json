{"text": " Most of you are probably aware that historically the Buddhist tradition has, in a sort of oversimplified perspective, three major training traditions. There's a lot of, you know, smaller stuff, but if we had to give you the big picture, there's an early practice associated with the Theravada school of Buddhism that's associated with Southeast Asia, and that's the vipassana practice that we're doing here. Then there's the Buddhism as it was modified in India, turned into something called Mahayana, or the great vehicle, and then transmitted to China, where it went through further really significant modification, and became the Chan or Zen school. And from China it went into Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, the cultures traditionally under Chinese influence. And then in India, Mahayana developed into Vajrayana, which is the diamond vehicle, which has some very interesting and distinctive ways of practicing, and that was transmitted primarily into the Himalaya and Tibet area, although some of it actually did reach Japan. My ordination as a monk in 1970 is in the Shingon school, which is Japanese Vajrayana, technically lineage-wise. As far as ordination goes, I belong to the Vajrayana tradition. Each of these traditions has within it a model for the spiritual path that involves two aspects, complementary aspects. And the words are a little different, but the basic idea is that there's an aspect of this practice, of this path, that we do for ourselves as an individual, that we can have an optimal happiness that's independent of conditions, that we can live our lives in a very satisfying way, and have a knowledge of deep spiritual reality. Then there's a complementary aspect, besides what we do for ourselves, how we reach out to others, both in terms of our affect, our feeling tone, and also in terms of our actions, the things that we do that are of benefit to the people around us, or broadly to our planet, or broadly to all sentient beings in the universe. In the early Buddhist tradition, as is exemplified by the Theravada, or teaching of the elders, that's what that means in Pali, the aspect of the understanding and the transformation that we do for ourselves is called vipassana, or observation, insight. And then the aspect that we do for others is grouped under the name metta, M-E-T-T-A, which literally means loving kindness. Now technically that's just one practice, but along with metta goes karana, which is compassion, and other types of practices that reach out into the world and help others. So there's sort of the two pillars of that tradition are the vipassana and the metta. In Mahayana, they talked about prajna, which means wisdom, and under that category comes all of those aspects of understanding, purification, etc., that we do for ourselves. And then instead of calling the other pillar by the name metta, or loving kindness, they called it karana. But again, and that means compassion, but under compassion are all the things like loving kindness, rejoicing in the spiritual successes of others, etc., the whole outreach program, so to speak. So you have metta and karana. And then in the Vajrayana tradition, they talk about prajna on one hand, which is the wisdom, and then upaya, U-P-A-Y-A, which means skillful means, the tools, the expedience, the things that one uses to reach out and influence and help others in a skillful way. So there's skillful means, upaya, it means that it's ways that you can reach out into the world of relativity, let's say, to help people at all different levels, and ultimately to lead them into the world of the quote absolute or wisdom prajna. So the point that I'm trying to make is that in each one of the three major training traditions of Buddhism, there is a sense of the complementarity of these two aspects of practice. And also in the Christian tradition, Christianity has actually an extraordinary tradition of mysticism behind it, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox forms. There's a place in Greece called Mount Athos, A-T-H-O-S, where people in the past and also in the present go, and they practice forms of meditation actually remarkably similar to vipassana. As I mentioned in the talk the first night, although there's no English word for vipassana, there is a Greek word, nepsis, and they would observe, and a lot of what they observed was their body sensations, and they'd observe with equanimity. Now their word for equanimity, again in Greek, was apatheia, which of course has given us the English word apathy. But apatheia in the Christian mystical tradition does not mean apathy. And when you read the spiritual writers, they're very, very careful to make the distinction. Apatheia is defined, they struggle in the same way that the Buddhist teachers do, to convey the sense of what equanimity is as opposed to passivity, indifference, et cetera, apathy. And as the result of this sober observation or nepsis, one gains sophia, which is prajna, wisdom, and one also gains catharsis, which is the Greek word for cleaning out. Nowadays catharsis has been sort of co-opted by psychotherapy and whatever, and people tend to think catharsis is some sort of dramatic display of things. But actually catharsis in the Greek literally means purging, in the sense of cleaning something out of yourself. And that was, so the goals are remarkably similar, and the methods are remarkably similar. But of course that was only one part of the process. Then one also had to reach out and give to others and be part of the world. And one of the Christian orders that developed in the Middle Ages was the Dominican order, they're sometimes called the Black Friars because they wore black ropes as opposed to the Brown Friars who were, I wonder if you know Christian history, Brown Friars were like Friar Tuck, he always, right, and Robin Hood, he's always in brown. Those are the Franciscans. St. Francis and St. Dominic were friends, but they had little different approaches. And in the Dominican order, they had a really nice motto for their order, which was to meditate and to give to others the fruits of your meditation. So that's that double motivation there. You're really meditating for yourself so that you can have mystical experience, mystical experience in the Christian tradition is defined as direct experience of God, experimental or experiential contact as opposed to just belief or faith or something like that. And then you want to give the fruits of that to others by reaching out. That's why the Dominicans, they were called the order of preachers because unlike other monks that would just live in monasteries and never go out into the public, they practiced intense meditation and then they would wander around and live by mendicancy, which is a fancy name for begging or as we call it by another fancy name, Dana, but it's begging nonetheless. So again, this theme comes up in other meditative and mystical traditions around the world. In the Mahayana or great vehicle, the ideal is to practice both aspects simultaneously. And a person that is sort of equally interested in the insight and purification for themselves, but the service and the helping and the giving to others from the very beginning of their practice is called a bodhisattva and a B-O-D-H-I-S-A-T-T-V-A. Now I'll just give you a little bit of historical background. The word bodhisattva, bodhi you probably know means awakening. It's from the root budh, B-U-D-H. The past participle buddha means an awakened one and the verbal noun, the act of awakening is bodhi. Anybody here speak any Slavic languages? Just curious, like Russian? You know it? Okay, well just to show you the relationship, languages, in Russian the word to wake up is buddhiti, okay? And that's the same root as buddha exactly because Slavic is Indo-European and although you may think of the buddha as being Asian and living in India, never forget the North India linguistically is directly linked to Europe. The language I'm now speaking to you in and the language that the buddha spoke 5,000 years ago go back to a single language, Proto-Indo-European. So buddha is a lot closer than you might think culturally and historically to the West. Anyway be that as it may, a sattva, S-A-T-T-V-A, means a being. Actually satt means to exist and it's like related to the Latin word sunt, you know, they are that kind of thing. Anyway a sattva is a being. And bodhisattva historically was a title that was given to a buddha to be. Do any of you know what the jataka stories are? The jataka means birth literally, jah means to be born, it's related to the like genesis, that word. And the jatakas are about 500 stories of the buddha in his former lives and the various things that he did to develop wisdom and compassion, make merit, that eventually allowed him in his life as Prince Siddhartha Gautama to attain bodhi and become buddha. So in the jataka stories, the buddha to be, and also in the biography of the buddha when he was Prince Siddhartha before he was enlightened, a buddha to be was referred to as a bodhisattva, a being heading towards bodhi. So it says, you know, when King Mahanama was reigning in the state of Magadha, the bodhisattva was born as the leader of a pack of elephants, okay. And then it goes on to say how that elephant sacrificed himself or something like that and therefore, you know, made this merit. So it was a way of getting the Indian custom of liking to tell stories and sort of weaving it into, you know, Buddhism and the more Buddhist teachings and morality and whatever. And the jataka stories sound very much like Aesop's fables stories, some of them, and that's no coincidence because the Aesop's fables also come from India. Like you know the story about the elephant and the blind man? You all know that story, right? But you probably don't know it comes from Buddhism. Okay, it's not a European story. Anyway, apropos of stories, I know I'm wandering a little bit, but it is historically interesting. One of the stories that reached Europe along with Aesop's fables is the story of Prince Josephat. And I'm going to tell you the story of Prince Josephat. It's a Christian story. You might find it interesting. He was a very popular saint in the Middle Ages in Europe. In fact, the patron saint of meditators and ascetics. You all know what ascetics are? Ascetics are people, as far as your friends are concerned, you're ascetics. Ascetics are people that deny themselves or put themselves through physical discomfort for a spiritual goal. So that was part and parcel of Christianity at one time. Actually part and parcel before Christianity wimped out in the 16th century. But anyway, that whole habit is interesting. So in the Middle Ages, there was a patron saint for meditators and ascetics, and it was Saint Josephat. And here's his story. You might find it interesting. Saint Josephat was actually born in India, and when he was born, the astrologer told his father that if he ever heard about Christianity, he'd leave the palace. And his father didn't want that to happen. So he kept him in the palace. But Prince Josephat managed to get out of the palace occasionally, and he met the Christian meditation master named Barlaam. And he abandoned his princely life, went out into the forest, and became a great Christian meditator and saint by practicing severe asceticism. Does this story sound vaguely familiar to any of you? It's obviously the story of the Buddha that passed from India and we worked and became a Christian legend. And there's still a Saint Josephat, and he's on the calendar, and he has a feast day and everything. But everybody knows that this is the Buddha. And so the Buddha actually is a canonized saint in the Roman Catholic Church. And his name, Josephat? Well, by the time that the story went from India to Europe, of course, it had to pass from the Middle Indic dialects, the Procrates, like Pali, and then that was translated into a circuitous route. It got translated into Persian, I think, and then from Persian into Arabic, and then from Arabic into, no, Persian into Hebrew, and then Hebrew into Arabic, and then Arabic into Latin, and finally got to the West. Something very complicated. So that by the time it passed through all those languages, you'd hardly realize that Josephat is a corruption of Bodhisattva, because the Buddha-to-be was always referred to as the Bodhisattva. When the Bodhisattva was a young prince, he went out into the, you know, he abandoned his father's palace, et cetera, et cetera. So historically, the term Bodhisattva, or in the Pali pronunciation, Bodhisatta, is a Buddha-to-be. And when the Mahayana, or great vehicle, arose about 500 years after the Buddha's death, they sort of reinterpreted this word Bodhisattva. They said, if you're really a Bodhisattva, if you're really on the path to becoming a world-transforming master, because that's the difference between a Buddha and an arhat. Arhat, if it's a male, or arhati, if she's a female, is a fully enlightened person, just as enlightened as the Buddha. But there is a difference. A Buddha has a greater ability to enlighten the world around him or herself. Liberation is liberation. There are living people now, arhats, that are just as enlightened as the Buddha was. But the whole world hasn't changed, okay, because they're not Buddhas. They don't have that power to shake the world. And they said, if you want to become a Buddha, you have to not just be interested in the wisdom that breaks the limited identity with the mind and body. You have to also, from the very beginning, have this maha-karna, or great compassion, that you're going to stay in the world and keep reincarnating and reincarnating out of concern for others. And that person that has that strong dual motivation from the beginning is said to have the bodhicitta, or the mind bent upon bodhi, and is called a bodhisattva. So particularly this interplay of wisdom and compassion is associated with the Mahayana tradition. When we sit here and we do these meditation techniques, this is the aspect of wisdom and purification, and it's more or less something we're doing for ourselves. But there's an intimate link between practicing these exercises and focusing that constitute the kogvipasana, and our ability to reach out into our world and be of benefit to others. In other words, there's an intimate link between the wisdom, the insight, that allows a person to break the limited identity with their mind and body, and the refinement of that mind and body to be of service to others. And to understand the link between these two aspects, in a sense it's a link between the impersonal and the personal, or it's a link between the transcendent and the imminent, or it's the link between the cosmic and the human. Lots of different ways that you can look upon it. But there is a link, and the link goes both ways. If you don't work on yourself, and if you don't make merit, it's difficult to practice meditation. I've met people that have meditated for many years who ask the question, you know, I don't understand. I've been really working hard, I've been really trying to apply these techniques and whatever, and somehow I'm just not getting it. And when you look at their lives, you see that they're not really serving others, or they're not, the term of the art is making merit, which sounds awful crass in English. It sounds much more spiritual in the Asian languages, but maybe there is some crassness behind it. But the idea is that the results on the cushion are not just a product of the work done on the cushion. They're a product of what one has put out into the world, what one has given, how one has served, the claimless service that one has done, either in this life or if you believe in the former life theory, in former lives also, that's going to affect what one's experience is on the cushion. And also the sila, how one has refined one's life and one's dealings with others is going to facilitate one's work on the cushion. So sometimes if you're stuck in your practice and find that your sitting just isn't coming along, what you might try as a little change of pace is service or just quote, making merit, putting something out there into the world. I'm not saying that it's going to be an automatic, that it's going to be easy to meditate or something, but as I say, the two are very linked. So on one hand, the degree to which one serves others and refines one's mind-body process is going to make it easier to meditate. Conversely, the breaking of the identity, my quick definition of enlightenment is the breaking of the limited identity with one's mind and body. Zen Master Dogen had an interesting expression. He said, shinjin datsu raku in Japanese, which is a little hard to translate, but it means something like breaking loose from the mind and body. I don't know, how do they translate, is there a standard translation? Breaking loose from the mind and body is how I would translate it. Raku means to fall away, okay? And datsu is the verb, like when a cicada breaks out of its shell, okay? That's datsu, or you take off clothes, that's datsu. So shinjin, shin means body and jin means mind, so shinjin datsu raku means sort of breaking the limited identity with one's thoughts and feelings. That doesn't mean that you no longer have thoughts and feelings, obviously. It just means that you have a new relationship to the thoughts and feelings, to the mind and body. The relationship being, well, I mean, a jail cell and your home, they look different, but the real important functional difference between a jail cell and your home is what? Well, one you can come and go, and the other one you're constrained to be there. So if you're in a jail cell and it gets too hot or too cold, you're stuck. You have no options. On the other hand, if something goes wrong with the heating in your house, you can go outside and go to a hotel room and stay where it's comfortable for a while. It's not your house, but you can live there. You can live anywhere. You can leave your house and live anywhere you want. You have that kind of freedom. But, of course, you come back to your house, but you don't have to stay there all the time. So that's the mind-body for most people are prison. They have to be there all the time. And all the things that can go wrong with the body and all the things that can go wrong with the mind. I mean, you know, I'm an intellectual addict. I'm still, even after years and years of meditation, addicted, just ask Shirley, to intellectual hobbies. But the fact is that all of my ability to think and reason is 100% dependent on the two-tenths of a milligram of thyroxine that I take every morning, because I don't have a thyroid gland. And after one week without that, my IQ drops to about 60. And after two or three weeks without that, my IQ will drop down to 30 or 40. And that's it. So that's moron. And that's basically, I'm just a moron that's being supported by this chemical. It's 100% dependent on that. It's going to all be wiped away if I can't get that thyroxine. It means nothing. So one's ability to function, even to think, to reason, to know what's up and what's down, is very, very dependent on conditions. That's why a wise person will cultivate their mind and body, but they won't pin all their happiness on that mind and body. I've actually had the rather amazing experience of going without the thyroid. This was in a hospital that they wanted people, in order to trace certain metabolic pathways, they asked for volunteers who would be willing to forego their thyroid. And they would take you right to the edge of what's called myxedema madness and then pull you back. So they assured me it was completely safe, but that I might feel a little weird. And I really wanted to see. I was curious. I wanted to know what that was like. And I'm very glad that I did it, because I got to experience insanity, dementia, and I got to live to talk about it. And I got to see my mind deteriorate day by day, my abilities to think and understand, sort of just, you know, my brains were just sort of dripping out of my ear, you know, day by day. And I got to see the effect of meditation. And I got to prove to myself that the effects of meditation quite transcend the chemistry of the brain. That's not to say that if you meditate, you won't go senile or get Alzheimer's or, you know, become myxedematous if you don't have your thyroid. Though those things will physiologically happen, but the relationship to them is very, very different. Very, very different. I used to, I was a terrible student when I began my practice. That's why I'm surprised that I get any good students at all, considering how horrible I was to my teachers, because I, you know, I thought I knew more than they did. And I gave them a hard time and I would try to ask them, you know, embarrassing questions. My very first teacher, for example, I said, well, you claim that there's this thing called enlightenment or whatever, but what happens to an enlightened Zen master when they get old and senile? Okay. Are they still enlightened when they get Alzheimer's? And ask questions like that, you know, sort of tough questions. And interesting, I got to actually get the answer to that one, partially from my own experience, but also by being around for many, many years, lots of, you know, masters, I got to see old senile ones and I got to see what that really was, that they truly were senile, but very, very different from other senile people. Different in a lot of ways. First of all, able to function better, because they were going on samadhi power. I once was at a public lecture by a, actually it wasn't a monk, it was a householder, a Japanese professor who was, you know, had meditated Zen all his whole life. And he was very old and very decrepit and his mind was going, okay. And he delivered public lectures and they were quite comprehensible. But afterwards he told me he had no idea what he was saying. He was just like he was in a fog, he didn't know where he was. He was functioning way beyond his capacity. But there's a limit, you know, I mean, he can't go too far, but he had all that samadhi power, all that concentration power, gives him a little edge that other people don't have. But the more important thing was the incredible grace and beauty. His senility was, I mean, it was beautiful, it was like a flower, you could just watch him and it wasn't off-putting or frightening or anything, you know, he just sort of, you know, sort of look out into space and you could tell where his mind was sort of going. But it was just beautiful, it was like a cat, it was just graceful and you could just watch it all day. So that's not like other people's, that's not like other people's dementia. So I got the answer to my question. Yeah, they become demented, but, you know, with a real significant difference. Yeah, because the breaking of the limited identity with the mind and body, once that is, that is, and nothing's going to change that. And so when that mind and body begin to deteriorate, one is still free. So since this mind-body process of ours is so subject to condition, the wise person will cultivate an understanding where they have a new relationship with their mind and body, which is its home, it's not prison. And there are many ways to do this, and one very good way is to really carefully observe the mind and body over and over again. Now I know the vipassana practice in some ways may seem anti-spiritual because at the beginning you seem to be paying attention to very, very mundane things. You're just, you know, you're just like super aware of and precise about itches all day. And so what does that have to do with seeing God? It's like it seems to be taking you, you know, into your body and into your thoughts and things like that. But as you observe with this sense of equanimity, this witness state, you're cultivating a non, you're taking away the stickiness of the mind-body. It's getting less and less like flypaper. And as you're observing very carefully, you're also getting insights into the nature of the mind-body. Different teachers will emphasize different aspects of this insight. I like to think of insight as like a jewel, like a diamond that has a lot of different facets to it, little faces, sides. You can look at it this way and you see, oh yeah, there's the side that's called transcendence of suffering. And oh yeah, there's a side that's called oneness with the universe. Oh yeah, there's the side that's called understanding how the sense of self wells up and fades. And oh yeah, there's the side of it that deals with your connection to the source. And there's all of these different sides to it. And different, as I say, different teachers dealing with different students upon different occasions, are going to emphasize different aspects. And that can be very confusing, because then it looks like they're talking about different critters. That's where, by the way, the metaphor of the four blind men and the elephant came from. The wisdom is the elephant, but if you look at this part of it, it feels like the trunk of a tree. And you look at this part, it's like a rope. And this other part, it's like something else. It's like a wall or something, but they're all part of the same elephant. The teachers that have influenced me most profoundly have emphasized the facet of wisdom called impermanence, anicca. That's one of the reasons why I like to emphasize that facet. There are many other facets, obviously. But first of all, it's the way I was taught. And secondly, I think of the basic Buddhist truths, it's the easiest one for people that aren't Buddhists to relate to, initially. Because if you start to try to convince people of anatta, which is the doctrine that there's no thing called a self inside us, that gets very confusing and off-putting, perhaps. Although it's for some very, very good reasons why the Buddha taught that way. But if you talk about dukkha, which is the essential painful nature of identification with the mind-body process or phenomenal existence, that's sort of a bummer and bums people out and doesn't sound very positive. You're trying to sell people on a doctrine that life is suffering and that there's no person there anyway. So then they say, well, why even bother meditating then if there's no self? It's really confusing to people. But the doctrine of impermanence, first of all, no one can deny it. All you have to do is look around the world and you see, all you have to do is look in the mirror and you see, it's getting a little grayer here, it's getting a little thinner, the flower wells up and then the flower fades. We can see it appears that we breathe, we expand and contract with our breath and the seasons expand and contract and the tide of our lives expands and youth and then contracts. And there seems to be some evidence that the universe as a whole expands and contracts. So it's not difficult to see that that change is constant. Panta Rhe, one of the ancient Greek philosophers said, Panta Rhe, all things flow. So it's a little easier to get a handle on. Secondly, although it can be made to sound quite pessimistic, you know, impermanence, it's all passing away, it can also be presented in a positive light because impermanence means change, change means movement, movement is flow, flow is energy. And as impermanence was presented in the early Buddhism, it's a kind of characteristic of existence. In fact, it's called one of the, Tilakkhana. Ti in Pali means three, Lakkhana means characteristic. In Sanskrit it would be three Lakshana. You can see how close Sanskrit and English are three, three. And the three Lakshana or three marks of existence are Anicca, Anatta, Dukkha in the Pali pronunciation. Anicca means impermanent, Anatta means no self, and Dukkha means uncomfortable, painful, suffering. So in early Buddhism, impermanence was presented as a sort of characteristic of existence. Don't get too caught up in things because, you know, it's always changing. But in later Buddhism, impermanence is presented in many other aspects, in deeper aspects. Impermanence isn't just the fact that things fade and pass away. Impermanence is also the fact that things rise up. There are two sides to impermanence. By the way, Sasaki Roshi, and I do believe that this is unique to him, his unique vocabulary, the words he uses are expansion and contraction. Expansion is the side of impermanence that affirms its life. It's the principle of increase, increase in intensity, increase in spatial extent, increase in complexity, are all aspects of the expansive side. It's the yang side of things, to use the Taoist term. Or in the Jewish mystical tradition, Kabbalah, they talk about two sides of Hashem, or God, the source, has two sides, chesed and gvura. And the expansive side, the arising side, is the giving side. So that's chesed in Hebrew. But things don't just intensify and spread and get complex, they also fade, collapse, and become simplified. And that's the denying side, the deaf side, the yin side, or the gvura, the sort of limiting and taking away. So there's an affirming side and a limiting side. In many of the mystical traditions of the world talk about this. And in these more, in the Mahayana formulation, especially as it's formulated in certain schools of Rinzai Zen, not all, deals with impermanence this way, as really the basic principle of the universe, and therefore identical with what in early Buddhism was called pratityasamutpada. Pratityasamutpada is, I know, many syllables. Maybe that's why they call it Pali, because it's so polysyllabic. But anyway, pratityasamutpada means that depending on conditions, things fall up. Samutpada means fall up. Pada means to fall, and utpada means to fall up. So it's just, when something falls, it just happens. Falling is an automatic process. There's no this or that about it. It's effortless, without any will or desire. Things just fall. Well, things coming into existence is without any will or desire. It's an effortless, spontaneous process that things just fall, but they fall up. They just well up, and then they fall down. They fade away. So this condition co-arising, or what in the Hebrew tradition would be referred to as briyayesh mahayana ayin, the continuous arising of things from the source, which is ayin, which is nothing. In the Mahayana formulation, impermanence is sort of your entryway into understanding the molding force of emptiness to form things and take things back into emptiness. So it's looked upon as a much deeper cosmic principle, and the reason that we breathe is because our bodies flow with expansion and contraction. The reason that our heart beats is that our bodies expand and contract. There's a systole and a diastole. All of these are looked upon as reflections of the fundamental principles of impermanence. When you look at a flower, for example, if you went to Sasaki Roshi, he might ask you, tell me, what is your experience of God when you see the flower? He'd give you a koan like that. And what he would want you to do is look at the flower and the expansive side of the flower. You let your whole body expand with that, and the contractive side of the flower, let your body contract with that. Its stem contracts. Its leaves expand. And your body would just, your whole being would just expand and contract with the activity of that flower's contour, and you'd be able to pass your first koan. Of course, 15 years later, he'll ask you the same koan again, because there's passing at many, many different levels. But you would do the activity called flower. Did you notice how the talk was expanding, and then the tape recorder manifested the contractive principle? Everything had to stop. It all had to collapse and become one point of changing the tape. And if you felt any discomfort, like, wait, I want to hear the next thought, or what was coming. That discomfort was the heat that arose between two cosmic forces moving in opposite directions. The force of expansion of the talk in time, and the force of contraction that made me stop talking. Those two forces rubbing against each other may have produced within some of you a kind of heat called the feeling of uncomfortableness, of like, you know, wait, what was he going to say, kind of thing. But if you were just riding on the forces of expansion and contraction, when it was time to turn around, at the expansive nature of the mind and body that happens when we have a talk, had to then contract into something very simple, mechanical. If you were really riding on expansion and contraction, there wouldn't have arisen that self that was impatient to hear the next word. So impermanence can have a very positive aspect to it. At the deepest level, when we're, so that when we're taking something like an itch, which seems so banal and ordinary, and watching that it's getting a little stronger, getting a little weaker, spreading here, pulling in there, you may say that this is trivial. Okay, so what? But what's behind the fact that the sensation intensifies or diminishes? What's behind the fact that the sensation pushes out here or pulls in there? What's behind it are the fundamental, the two hands of God molding that experience, the right hand and the left hand. And if you pay it close enough attention, long enough, with enough precision and enough detachment, you start to actually see that itch being molded by these invisible hands. And pretty soon there's just the molding without any clay in between being molded. And that's the pure act. There's no itch as a thing anymore. There's just the pure contour, the pure activity of consciousness, which is so many vibrations, expansions, contractions, what have you. And it goes from being a thing called an itch, a noun, to a verb. Or in terms of physics, it goes from being a particle to a wave. That's why the de Broglie wave function is very interesting from a Buddhist perspective. Any of you who have studied physics, material things can be looked upon as waves. Even something as material as a bowling ball can be looked upon as a kind of matter wave. And we can assign, a physicist can quantify that wave, quantify it in terms of its amount. He can actually say it's this kind of wave. So this is a deeper aspect of impermanence. Impermanence isn't just a pessimistic philosophy, everything passes away. Impermanence, and so as we're looking at phenomena, we're looking very carefully, from time to time, the quote impermanence starts to become evident. And the more detached we are, the more evident it becomes. Sometimes I like to ask a sort of whimsical question, do mountains dance? And it's a multiple choice question. The choices being yes, no, or it depends. And the answer I would choose is it depends. Depends on what? Depends on how carefully and how patiently you look at the mountain. If you aren't able to look very carefully or very patiently, mountain is a metaphor of permanence. But anything beyond the molecular level of precision and observation, you see nothing but energy change, dance of, wild dance of molecules and atoms and particles. On the other hand, it not only depends on how precisely you look, it also depends on how patiently you look. If you were so patient that a century passed like a second, if you looked at the mountains over millennia, what would they look like? What would the hard surface of the earth look like in time-lapse photography? It would actually look like the seething surface of the ocean, or the rippling of living protoplasm. So in the same way, I'm quite aware that many phenomena in the mind and body appear to be quite solid. And that's okay. There's nothing in this practice that says, there's nothing in the canons of vipassana that say thou shalt experience impermanence. The canons, the axioms of vipassana, just say, they don't even say thou shalt. They say do your best to be as precise and as open as possible and just keep doing that no matter what happens. That's all that is basic. If you're doing that, you're doing vipassana right. But as you're doing that, sometimes the precision becomes very great and you start to detect that, hey, the mountains really made of vibrating atoms. Or the equanimity, the patience becomes very great. And you can see very stately patterns of expansion and contraction in what seemed to be something very rigid and unmoving. And if that happens, great. Go with it. Ride on it. Let it massage you. Let it take you into deeper and deeper states. But if that doesn't happen, that's okay. You're still purifying consciousness. Any time anything comes up in the mind-body, be it pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, and one infuses a mindfulness and equanimity, one is by definition transforming and purifying consciousness. How do we know that? Well, we know it by how we feel and how we act as the result of this practice. We feel light and empty in a positive sense on the inside. So we feel that there's been catharsis. Something has been lifted from us. The limiting forces from the past, call them engrams, imprints, or use the Sanskrit word samskara, they're being wiped away by the mindfulness and the equanimity. This is the process of purification. It's not necessarily that you're going to have insight into impermanence in your first retreat or your tenth retreat or your hundredth retreat, but sooner or later these things do start to become evident. But you're definitely purifying. That's a linear thing. As soon as you sit still and have some detachment, you're transforming consciousness. Impermanence is also spoken of as a sort of helper on the meditative path by certain teachers, actually within the Vipassana lineage, in the Upa-Khin lineage, which goes back to a contemporary Burmese master and is taught by various teachers. They talk about activating impermanence and how the flow of impermanence sort of carries you deeper into meditation. And it's almost like a comforter. And you sort of ride on these waves and vibrations and they sort of do the work for you. Just like if you drop an Alka-Seltzer tablet in water, all these bubbles form and the bubbles dissolve the tablet. As you're paying attention to impermanence, the impermanence starts to sort of meditate you, or at least this is an experience that can happen to people. So these are some aspects of the insight process. Basically, one way that I like to think about it is that I talked about the vulnerability of the mind and body. What is the mind and body from the viewpoint of the science of thermodynamics? I know thermodynamics is sort of like an awesome, sounds like a very heavy thing, and it is actually a very heavy thing, a very heavy branch of science, one of the deepest branches of physics. But just to explain simply, there is an ordering principle in the universe and there are also disordering principles in the universe. A living body is a very, very highly ordered system and a thinking mind is an even more highly ordered system. When we talk about the vulnerability of the mind and body, what we really mean is that the ordering principle is eventually subject to decay. In the end, disorder wins. Entropy always wins out in the big picture. But there are little pockets of negative entropy, that is to say of high organization, in the universe. And as far as we know, two outstanding examples of negative entropy or high organization are living bodies in general, not just human bodies, any of the bodies. And of course, as you go up the evolutionary scale, the organization gets more and more complex. Basically what life is, is an upwelling out of a sea of disorder. You have this pocket of high ordering that sort of arises and it's pushed into existence. And then on top of the high ordering of the way our bodies function is the even higher ordering of the way our thinking minds function. But unfortunately, we come into existence in a sea of disorder. No wonder the Buddhists talk about impermanence. So what happens is that when our bodies function properly and feel good, then they're well ordered. And when our minds can get answers and are clear and not confused, they're well ordered. And the body that feels good and is functioning right is a happy body. And the mind that can figure out things and has answers and isn't confused is a happy mind. But the mind and body are only happy because they're in their state of high order. If we want to have a happiness that's independent of conditions, we have to find an ordering principle that is so deep that it's deeper and more fundamental and more primordial than the ordering principle of our minds and bodies. An ordering principle that underlies our minds and bodies but survives the dissolution of the mind and body. So when the mind doesn't have answers, when you're confused, when you can't think straight, when you don't know, that's a disordering principle in the mind. When your body is uncomfortable, it doesn't work right. Disordering principle in the body. If you have made contact with something that is an ordering principle so primordial that it is not disturbed no matter what happens to your mind and body, and if you not only make contact with it but if you identify with that and say, this is what I truly am, then this is one way to describe transcending the mind and body and it's also one way to describe immortality. That would be such an ordering principle. Okay, I said the seasons expand and contract, okay. As you're observing something as seemingly trivial as the fact that the itch is a little stronger or a little weaker, you're watching the flow of impermanence, the expansion, the contraction, the movement. And to the extent that you're paying attention to that, you're paying attention to something that is an ordering. It's a kind of ordering. And your mind will be happy even if it's confused. Your mind will still feel ordered if it's aware that the confusion expands and contracts, okay. Confusion gets a little more, gets a little less, okay. It spreads, it diminishes. Confusion itself is a disordering but it's ordered by expansion and contraction. And if your body's uncomfortable or not working right, the pain spreads and then diminishes and expands and contracts. And if your body is in contact with its impermanence and your mind is in contact with its impermanence, then regardless of what happens in the mind and body, you'll be in contact with something that makes you feel grounded and safe and complete and invulnerable. And you can keep that contact no matter what happens with the mind and body, even though you faint in pain or even though the chemistry of your brain so deteriorates that you don't know who you are or where you are. Expansion and contraction, you won't lose contact with them, no matter how disordered. This is called understanding your true nature, what you truly are. And in vipassana, what you do is you observe this. You observe first in vipassana, you observe phenomena. And as you observe phenomena long enough, you start to get in contact with the impermanence of phenomena and then that contact becomes really significant until it just predominates everything. And then you identify with impermanence. You say, this is what I am. I am not a thing called a self. I am an activity called personality that expands and contracts in many dimensions, vibrates. And so you actually become impermanence. The way Sasaki Roshi puts it in sort of that suggestive and difficult Zen way of describing things, if you go in and he'll fail you on your koan, okay, and he'll say, the answer to this koan must have as its content life and death. What the hell does he mean by that? You know, what do you mean? He said, you can't answer this koan because the answer has as its content life and death. For years I wondered what the hell he meant by that. What does he mean? What's life? Expansion. What's death? Contraction. To have it as your content means that's what you are. Usually our content is our thoughts and our feelings. That's what I am. My content is my ideas and my sensations. So what if my content is expansion and contraction? Then when I look at a flower, okay, then what's my content? So then you have become impermanence. It's the cosmic reparenting. We're born in between, in the folds of this ocean of empty vibrations. And we're born moment by moment like so much foam churned up by the waves of the sea. And we're reincorporated back into that empty ocean. So we're the offspring of expansion and contraction in this particular paradigm. Are there other paradigms? Yeah. Are they just as good? Yeah. This just happens to be the one I'm familiar with. A human child is born in between a human mother, a physical mother and a physical father. And eventually matures to the point where that child is ready to be a mother or a father. So they have become parent. They were born from parent and then they become parent. In the same way, we're born out of impermanence, born out of emptiness, born out of God, if you want to use that vocabulary. And eventually we mature to the point where we become impermanence. We realize that we have as our content the vibration, the elastic rubbery vibration of emptiness. Now I know emptiness may not seem like rubber to you. Emptiness, in fact, for most people when they hear the Buddhist theories of emptiness, are totally either confused or put off. It's a vocabulary designed to repel Westerners, I think. But if you want to think about emptiness, what emptiness is like, think about a bouncy basketball. It's very rubbery, very elastic, very vital. If that seems strange to you, ask any physicist anywhere in the world what the nature of empty space is. And they'll say, well, actually what Einstein showed, or they'll say modern physics is called relativistic quantum physics. And what relativity tells us is that space, as well as time, is rubbery, can be stretched, bent. And in fact, mass, which is very much related to materiality, is now defined as the curvature of empty space. The curvature, the contour, of empty space. And what's light? What's between us and the sun? We say light waves. Well, if you're in a bathtub and you move your hand here and there's a transfer of energy over here, there's a physical medium that carries that transfer of energy. That's the water, the molecules of the water. Something happens in the sun, and what is it, eight minutes later, six minutes later, something happens on the earth. We say a light wave traveled from the sun. What's between us and the sun? Well, yeah, there's a few molecules of gases and things, but basically there is nothing between us and the sun, except space. So space is the medium that transfers the vibration of light. Space is looked upon as an elastic medium, and that's the quantum level of physics. So in the macroscopic, space is rubbery, and that's an aspect of relativistic physics. And in the microscopic, space is vibratory, and that's an aspect of quantum physics. It seems strange, when it was first discovered, it seemed very strange to people. Now it's standard physics everywhere in the world. It may seem very strange to say that emptiness is vibratory and vital and alive, so you don't have to fear it, but that is the experience of meditators. So just as there are many facets to liberation, to insight, and one of those is impermanence, there are many facets to impermanence, and it's been treated by different teachers in different ways. I started this talk by saying that an important theme on the spiritual path is the interplay between the impersonal and the personal, between the transcendent and the human, which of course is also the relationship between impermanence, or emptiness, and how we live our lives. On one hand, how we live our lives makes it easier for us to eventually reparent, in the ultimate sense, that we become parent, we become expansion and contraction. In other words, we share in the activity of the Source. Obviously no human being is God, but you can do the activity of God, and in doing so you participate in the Source. So that's the ultimate reparenting. Now you're like your Source, you've become your Source. But then, what kind of self do you give rise to? You're now channeling yourself. When things come up in day-to-day life, we would like to respond in a truly human way, and our ability to go beyond the human is a great aid in responding in a truly human way. Let's say, this was what someone brought up in one of the interviews, there's a person in their life that has done something that they consider, and based on what they told me I would have to agree, something quite unconscionable. How should I respond to this person? What should I do? Should I just ignore that fact and not do anything and not make waves? Should I confront? What should I do? What I believe we should do is something very difficult. And so we have to be willing to be like a baby that tries to walk and falls, and just picks themselves up and tries to walk again and falls. They fall to the right, they fall to the left, they fall to the right, they fall to the left, until they learn how to walk. So a baby does this miraculous thing of going from just a mass of uncoordinatedness to being able to walk. They have to be willing to do it over and over again and fail until they can do it right. It's a very difficult thing. In fact, I suppose for a baby it's an impossible thing, but somehow it gets done. So there's an impossible thing that we as, who are attempting to become truly spiritual adults, we have to learn how to walk in a way that may seem impossible. But if we're patient enough and just keep trying and keep picking ourselves up, eventually we can learn how to do this. And what that is, is when a person has done something and we have to confront them, we're angry. Okay, we're angry. That's feelings in the body and ideas in the mind. This is not right, etc., etc., etc., ideas in the mind, and uncomfortable sensations in the body. And we have to confront this person. Of course, we can just confront them without any intermediate steps, but that's basically human history. And look where human history has ended up. So if we want to be really mature, we can try something very different. Two intermediate steps, both of which are quite challenging. The first is, you have a mind and body that's erupting in anger, dissolve it into impermanence, expansion and contraction. That's very difficult, especially if the anger is justified and the sensations are intense. Dissolve it back into its atoms, so that's the first big challenge. Essentially it's sort of like alchemy, you're trying to change one substance into another. Let me just backtrack for a moment. You can have two statues that are identical. They have the same form, but they're made out of different substance. One's made out of clay, one's made out of gold. From a certain perspective, they're the same. From another perspective, they're quite different. The difference is the substance out of which they're made. The similarity is the form. If you can dissolve, and I'm using anger here, but you can take many different things, situations. If you can dissolve the mind-body state back into its primordial substance-lessness, in other words, instead of having the content of judging thoughts and angry sensations, you have the content of expansion and contraction, or put alternatively, life and death. That becomes your content. Now, that's substance-less. You can then take that and reform that into a new substance called loving-kindness. If the caterpillar wants to become a butterfly, it has to be willing to allow all of the substance of caterpillar to dissolve. If you know what's inside a chrysalis, it's just liquid. The caterpillar dissolves, there's no more caterpillar, and then reforms as a butterfly. So one dissolves the hate into pure energy, and then reforms that energy into a new substance called loving-kindness. But that's only half the battle. That's why this is such a tremendous challenge. Once you now have this new substance, you have to take that substance and mold it into the form of confrontation. So it has, in a sense, the form of anger, but it has as its content, or substance, loving-kindness. And then you confront. And it could be quite an intense confrontation, but it's different, because the confrontation has, is made out of a different thing. If you can do this, you are a master. You are a master. I call this, in my own vocabulary, I do believe that there's a phrase in French, coup de ma\u00eetre. Am I right? Is there such a phrase? It means the master stroke. Is that correct? Right. Okay. So this is the master stroke, if you want to know what it means to be a master, as far as I'm concerned. It would be the ability to take something like legitimate and intense anger, dissolve it back into its primordial expansion and contraction, recreate it into a new substance called loving-kindness, and then mold that substance into an appropriate confrontation. This is where the link between the transcendent and the human is seen, okay? Because that ability to go beyond the mind and body, that's not human, okay? That's not a human thing. And then to take that non-human thing and mold it into a form that is useful in the human world is to truly be an incarnation. So these are some thoughts that I just wanted to share with you, apropos of, you know, the essence of the practice that we're doing here. And there's quite a few of you that are first-timers to this, and I wanted you to get a sense of sort of the big picture, you might say. Because you can easily have a sense of a small picture that we're just sitting here like bumps on a log. Okay. Yeah. Do you have a third question? I'm just a little afraid because I'm already 15 minutes behind, but maybe tomorrow? Oh, you're not going to be here? Okay, go ahead. I'll try to answer quickly. I just wanted to say what it was like being a Varanic yogi. Yeah. Yeah. It was, I couldn't do a formal technique of meditation, okay? I couldn't organize myself enough to remember there's a thing called meditation and you sit down and do this. But I just felt very peaceful and happy and safe. And the sense of the impermanence, the flow of things, and the sense of safety and okayness that goes with that, that wasn't touched by the chemistry. I was just there. So I couldn't function and I couldn't think very well. But there was a part of me that couldn't be touched. And that part was not a thing, though. It was an action, the Buddha nature, which is the Buddha activity. I guess that's the best I could put it into words.
