{"text": " I wanted to just share some stray thoughts of mine on the topic of meditation in action or carrying meditation into day-to-day life. I think there are a couple of ways that we can look at this. One is, if you do enough consistent meditation on the cushion, which you might call the meditation in action kind of thing, there will automatically be a spillover into day-to-day life. So even if you don't formulate particular strategies or go about actively trying to meditate in day-to-day life, if you do enough of the daily cushion kind of practice, it will start to happen to you anyway. Therefore, from one perspective, you don't have to worry so much about how to meditate in day-to-day life, as long as you really have a daily sitting kind of thing and one comes to the periodic retreats. What I usually recommend for people is a minimum half an hour to an hour daily sitting, if not every single day, then more or less, and then one day retreat per month or a weekend every few months. The other way to look at it is that it's also useful to formulate strategies for intentionally working to cultivate meditation in daily life. Daily life means any off-the-cushion time, as we're talking to people, driving the car, bopping around, achieving our life goals, this kind of thing. This is daily life. So sitting here listening to a lecture, I'm talking now, you're listening, this is daily life. There are a whole lot of different possible strategies that a person can use. I just wanted to, as I say, in a sort of desultory way, talk about some of the ones that I've tried and some of the sort of pitfalls and successes that await a person. It's good learning theory to do what are called graded exercises. For example, when you start out to learn a topic, they don't give you something that's overwhelming at the beginning. You learn little pieces of it and gradually the exercises become more and more challenging. And I think that that's something to keep in mind. I remember when I first started to meditate in Japan, my teacher gave me the breath meditation, and it was the Zen-style breath meditation, not the vipassana anapana of observing, but it was breath counting. And I did that for a number of months, and I went to him and I said, he was a tea master, he used to always make tea for me, you know, when I'd go. So I went and he prepared this bowl of tea, and I said, my meditation's getting very interesting. And he said, oh, in what way is it interesting? I said, well, when I started to meditate, my thoughts were just screaming in my head, and my legs were just aching, and now I notice that that internal dialogue is still going on, but it's more like a whisper. My voice is sort of off in the distance, and there's a quietness to it. And also I notice that even though there's still pain in my legs, it doesn't seem to bother me so much. It sort of is passing through or it's wave-like. And there's a kind of distinctive quality of calm in my body, it feels real settled. And also my breath is slowing down spontaneously, even though sometimes I don't count the breath or work with it, it just of its own seems to get very slow and even. I described these phenomena to him, and he said, oh, that's very good, that's very good. You are starting to enter samadhi. Of course, he used the Japanese version of the word zamai or sammai. In Sanskrit, it's samadhi. Now, I had been a student of Buddhism academically for a number of years before I ever put the tush to the kush, so to speak. And I was very familiar with this Buddhist technical term, samadhi. In fact, I could tell you the term in a dozen classical languages of Asia, but I had no experiential referent whatsoever for what it was. I just read about it. It's the generic term, of course, for states of concentration in the Buddhist tradition. And the Hindus use the word also in a related way, slightly differently. So the thought popped in my head, oh, that's what that word means. This is what they're talking about. And I was really happy, you know, I was smiling. And then he said, I mean, in the next, he said, that's very good, you're starting to enter samadhi. And in the next breath, he said, now you have to be like that all the time. And the thought popped into my head, come on, are you kidding? Because it would take me about two hours of struggling on the kush. And after about two hours, I could start to get these effects. Two hours, that's what he had us do, two one-hour periods. And after that, I could just barely get some of those feelings of the settledness, the breath slowing down. And it was like a struggle. I had to keep struggling to it. And now this guy's saying, I have to be like this all the time. I said, how? How can I do that? This whole conversation is in Japanese, and it's a different language, you know, and a different body vibe and everything. He talked like a samurai, it was really neat. He talked from his stomach, you know, and he said, just do it, you can do it. Sort of like a shogun giving a command. Well, what I started to do is, I started to take simple things. I realized that probably the reason I was able to get into those concentrated states as I was sitting there was that it was sort of the ultimately simple activity, the activity of no activity, just sitting on the kush. So it occurred to me, probably a good learning strategy would be to start doing the minimum kinds of activities and see, can I preserve this in exceedingly simple activities. So the first thing I tried was, I tried to walk and see if I could be in that state walking. And I found that I could do it if nothing else was around. But as soon as I tried to walk down a street where there were stores and people coming at me, I couldn't do it. So I would just do it like, you know, in an environment which was visually very simple. And yeah, if I walked real slow, I could sort of get that feeling that I associated with the quote samadhi. So then the next challenge was, okay, can I walk down the street and do it? So I tried and tried and tried, and finally I could get a little sense, yeah, I could walk down the street, but I had to really detach from the visual field, not let that pull me away too much. So, okay, so then the next challenge, I was living in a temple, I was a monk, and we, one of the things, you know, there's a lot of physical labor, usually simple physical labor tasks around the temple, and I came to understand why there were so many of those, of course, as I came to appreciate how that works. Because I would start with the simplest tasks, which were like raking sand and washing floors. You do a lot of this thing in Japan of you get down on your hands and knees with these dry rags, and that's why those floors look, those wooden floors look the way they look, because, you know, 500 years of young monks have been going down with these dry rags on them. So I found, yeah, I could do that. I could do that when we were, you know, when we were going over the floors, that was very simple, very repetitive activity. I also came to appreciate why, say, in the Christian meditative tradition, they have nuns do tasks like stamp out communion wafers all day for 50 years. You know, that's either heaven or hell. There's no in between. If the mind's wandering, that's just total hell. But it's a very simple task, so you can, you know, give yourself fully to it. It's just very repetitive, simple things. So as I say, I came to understand why in the East and West they have these sort of simple, repetitive tasks. The Christian monks and nuns used to say, ora et labora, okay, work and pray. So, and I found another very simple task, actually the very first thing I found that I could remain focused in, other than the just sitting, was chanting. That's a, that's pretty, that's still an activity, but that's such a, you know, first of all, your body's pretty stable. That's the difference between chanting and singing, one of the differences. And it's like a very simple activity. So I found, you know, like we would chant in the mornings, mako zhnyo haramitashin, uu, like that, you know, and I could get pretty concentrated doing that. So, but what would blow it was washing dishes, because that was too complex. Okay, so then that was the next challenge, right, can I do it washing dishes? And again, I had, found I had to detach even more from the visual field and just sort of become the activity of washing the dish. So gradually, one thing after another, you know, I just gave myself graded exercises. Finally, I could do it while washing dishes. What was the ultimate challenge? What do you think the ultimate challenge? Huh? Sex. Actually, well, as a monk, I didn't have a chance to practice that, right. Actually, what somebody said was talking, okay, talking to people. Boy, that would, that would really pull me right out. And I really, I thought, never, never will I be able to have conversations with people and get that. And it would pull me right out of meditation. And then I went through this whole thing of like, it was actually painful. I'd like try to fight my way back, you know, and it would take me sometimes a half an hour or something, or an hour to sort of get back after a conversation. And actually, I tried and tried and tried, and it just didn't work. But what happened was, after enough months passed, the thing that I mentioned at the very beginning of this talk, that I'd been doing so much, you know, sitting and working on these other things, I started to notice that even though I couldn't figure out a strategy to do it, I just was going into meditative states as I was talking to people. I would just feel those effects. I'd feel the breath slow down. I'd feel the body settle, etc., etc. So it started to happen to me, you might say. So that's why I said that there's two angles that we approach this issue of meditating in daily life. One angle is, just do enough of the daily kinds of sitting, and you'll find you will be meditating in daily life. Another angle is to actually formulate specific strategies. So this thing, I found that the idea to maintain groundedness when I was speaking to be beyond any strategy I could figure out at that time. So time passed, and as the months passed, it started to happen to me. It was really neat. I mention all of this to give you one aspect, which is the concept of graded exercises that you can try to work, and don't worry if you can't figure out your tax bill or have sex or drive the car and still be in meditation. That may be a little bit of a more advanced exercise, so maybe next year. A couple things I noticed, there are little tricks of the trade in terms of ways that you can bring the meditative state into daily life. One is that there are a lot of dead moments during the day, little moments when you're just sitting waiting or in between two activities or something like that, actually probably sitting here listening to me, you're not completely listening. There will be little dead moments when you just rest for a while or something like that. There was one Japanese monk I knew who used to talk about stealing minutes during the day. You could take those little dead moments and make those meditation times. I saw a thing on 20-20, I don't know if any of you saw it, I guess it was yesterday, about a scientist at MIT that studies mathematically and scientifically how people wait, lines and queue theory and things like that. It's awesome. We will spend about one to three years, years of our life actually waiting for things, waiting in line, a real significant amount of time spent, hours and hours and hours and hours spent. In what for most people is dead time or frustrating time. You can take those moments and make them meditation times, whatever your meditation technique is. You could just sit and meditate. That's one of the first things I started to notice when the meditation was working or giving me a little bit of a little edge on life. I used to hate wasting time. It would drive me crazy and I used to hate waiting for things. And all of a sudden I started liking it. I started liking waiting for planes in the airport. I started liking waiting in the doctor's office, even waiting in line, because there was no responsibilities on me. It's just sort of a bump on a log time. And no one expects you to do anything. Riding in buses, no one expects you to do anything. So you can be secretly meditating. You can be stealing minutes during the day. You learn to find those dead times and make use of them. So that's one strategy that I found useful, so that you have your formal meditation that you do, and then you have your activities of daily life, and maybe a half dozen or a dozen times a day, you have 30 seconds here, 5 minutes there, 15 minutes there, and you just meditate in those little dead times. And that starts to fill in the gaps, you might say, between your cushion meditation and your bopping around and doing things. That's another little strategy. Another thing I found useful, well, there's a number of, how should I say it, approaches that people can take to maintaining meditation. One thing that I found useful, though, is the idea, this sort of goes with the graded exercises, that each day, if a person takes at least one very ordinary activity, it could be anything at all, washing the dishes or talking to a person, if you're meeting with the public, there'll certainly be some interaction that's not that super-duper important, but you have to sort of be with a person and listen to them or something like that. If each day you take at least one very ordinary real-life activity and make a conscious intention from beginning to end to make it a meditation period, consider it to be a sitting. So, you know, in the temples, for example, the meals are called, the morning meal is called gruel sitting, okay, in other words, cereal, your porridge sitting, and the noon meal is called cooked rice sitting, because you have porridge for breakfast and regular cooked rice for lunch. But they use the word za, as in zazen, zafu, meaning sitting. They actually sort of consider, they call it shuku za, that's porridge sitting, and hanza is the rice sitting. And they consider it to be a meditation period, as though you were on a cushion. So you can have a conversation sitting, or you can have a drive-the-car sitting, and you say, from beginning to end, you know, however long this is, maybe it'll be a half an hour, an hour, whatever it is, from beginning to end, I'm going to make this a meditation period for me. And you formulate a strategy for doing so, and I'll be talking about some possible strategies. And then afterwards you can evaluate, how did I do? Not, of course, evaluate in a judgmental way with cravings and aversions, but sort of like, you know, just like in science or business, you do something, and then you look back and you make an analysis, what worked, what didn't work, where I lost it, what I learned kind of thing. So you have, in addition to your cushion formal sitting period, you have a meditation in action sitting during the day, with an analysis afterwards. If you do one of those each day, that's good. You don't have to become what I call a meditation robot. By that I mean that you necessarily, you don't want to worry about staying in meditation every single minute of the day. If you can have one period like that, that's fine. Now then, from that, if you can extend out to where more and more of the day is encompassed in meditation, then that's very, very good. But what I found was sometimes I was beating myself up because I was trying too hard or something, to always be in a meditative state. If you can do that, of course, that's fantastic. Eventually that will happen. But what I do is I sort of divide the day up. Sometimes some activities I intentionally meditate. Other times, though, like sometimes when I drive, there's a good example. Sometimes I get in the car and I decide this is a meditation period. And I have a strategy. My strategy for driving the car, well, obviously, you know, you don't want to, you can't close your eyes and watch your breath or, you know, things that people usually associate with meditation. How do you meditate when driving the car? Well, my strategy is that I just drive the car. When you're on the cushion and you do breath meditation, how do you do that? You relax your body. It gets settled in. You focus on the breath, which is relevant. Every time the breath, you wander from the breath, you just gently return. And you keep the settled body. So when I get in the car, if I decide that this is going to be a driving meditation period, I'll sort of settle in behind the wheel. I'll feel my body settle. And I'll start driving. Well, what is driving? Driving is you feel the car, you see the road, and that's about it. Anything other than feeling the car, seeing the road, maybe hearing the sounds of the other cars, anything other than that is not driving. Any fantasies of past, fantasies of future, evaluations, getting caught up in pleasant or unpleasant feelings, playing games with license plates or watching the signs, all of that is not just driving. So I'll just drive, and every minute or two I'll check in. Does my body have that quality of settledness that I associate with samadhi? And I'll just be watching the road, feeling the car, watching the road, feeling the car, watching the road, feeling the car. Anytime I find myself not doing that, I come back to watching the road, feeling the car. At the end of that, let's say I've driven for an hour, I should feel approximately the same way that I would feel after an hour sitting on the cushion. And amazingly, it does work. There's a strategy for driving meditation. Sometimes I get in the car and I do that. Sometimes I get in the car and I flip on the radio and I go and I buy some Chinese tea cakes and I just kick back and I just munch and I listen to the radio and I forget that I ever knew anything about meditation and I just trip out and fantasize and just drive the car the way everybody else drives the car. The point is that there's a conscious decision in my mind when I'm going to make it a meditation and when I'm not. And if I decide it's a meditation, I stick to it. Now, some days I try to actively meditate all day, especially, of course, in retreats. You want it to be, you know, the time you get up to the time you hit the bed again is like absolutely unbroken meditation. And some days I'll try to do that too, like during the day. But other times I'll just let myself be in a very scattered, ordinary state. So I try not to get, how can I put it, get too uptight about, you know, meditating all the time. Now, I just gave you one situation and I gave you a strategy for meditating in that situation. It's car driving meditation. Each person can formulate their own strategies for different situations. I'm just going to share with you some of the repertoire of strategies and each, as I say, people figure out what works for them. One thing that I found very useful is to work to ground myself in the sensations within my body. Because with each moment by moment change in our physical situation, there are changes in the body sensations. And the body sensations are the conduit into what in Buddhism we call Vedana. Vedana is feeling, very important component of our experience along with thinking, hearing, seeing, and this kind of stuff. And I don't know that every feeling or emotion is necessarily in the body. Some people say it is. But what I do know is that by paying attention to the body sensations, whenever you are focusing and feeling the body, your awareness is directed into the feeling component of life. Feeling is the world that babies live in. It's the world that animals live in. It's that about which we say pleasant, unpleasant. Of course, a lot of feelings are indescribable. Also, mixtures, things like that. So, as I'm talking to you now, I'm talking, but there are sensations, there are feelings within me. Now, whenever feelings are subliminal, that is to say, semi-conscious, they turn into forces on a person's life. This is a fundamental and very, very profound insight. One may wonder why it is moment by moment, moment by moment, this world seems less than completely satisfactory. Because when we affirm a spiritual ideal, it should be that the reality is the spiritual reality. Everything that strikes the eye or the ear should have about it something of a quality of perfection. And yet, moment by moment, it doesn't seem to, usually. And one may also wonder why it is year after year, year after year, the same negative patterns come up, despite the fact that our logical mind knows better. We find ourselves year after year, year after year. Well, it's because there's a force field that is limiting our perception and limiting our actions. And that force field actually is intimately associated with semi-conscious or unconscious feelings. So if you can keep grounded moment by moment in the feelings and work to bring what is subliminal to, I guess we would use the words, to the supraliminal. Liminal means threshold, okay? So subliminal means below the threshold of direct perception. We want to bring those feelings, those waves of sensation above the threshold of perception, where they can be observed by the adult mind instead of being simply felt by the infant mind, the unconscious. And lo and behold, they lose their power to limit our perception moment by moment and to cause negative behavior year after year. So one strategy, a very good one, is to keep grounded moment by moment in the body sensations. As I'm talking to you now, as I look at each one of you, or there's any change at all in my visual field, each time I look at one of you, I get a change in the flow of feeling within me. And if I can be aware of that and keep it fluid and open and accepting, cognizant of its essential impermanent nature, lo and behold, the sense of separation between inside and outside becomes less and less. And all sorts of other good things happen. So one strategy is keep grounded moment by moment in body sensations. That is the strategy that I ultimately found worked for staying in meditation when I talk to people. It works for me personally. Now, of course, whenever I mention this, people always say, well, isn't that like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time? People have that feeling. Well, I'm doing it. Okay. Of course, it's harder, considerably harder than patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. The fact is, is with practice, it can become second nature so that it won't interfere with your ability to function in a natural way. But you may have to pass through an awkward intermediate state where you feel very stilted and zombie-like and sort of out of touch and off balance as you're trying to ride these two horses at once. That is to say, you know, be doing something and at the same time feel how that impacts. But, as I say, as time goes on, a skill develops, you can do both at the same time. And it's a very powerful thing. In fact, by and large, just about any time that you are consciously trying to implement a strategy of meditation in action, you will probably have to go through an awkward intermediate zone in your training where you feel, and you may even look rather stilted and stiff and zombie-like and uncomfortable and slowed down or something like that, unnatural, as you're trying to keep this meditation going and function in the world. But it's just a temporary, awkward intermediate realm. And as I say, as the skill comes into place, you can be quite fluid and dynamic and appear like everybody else. But this meditation strategy is going on. So that's one thing. And even as I'm speaking to you moment by moment, isn't it true, every couple seconds, the body sensations change, the qualities change. Every time a person scratches, every time a person stretches their back, that's being done in response to sensations. Are those sensations conscious or unconscious? As I'm speaking, if I say something that's entertaining, there's a little bit of warm, you know, entertained, pleasant sensation. If I say something that's confusing, it doesn't seem to make sense, it's hard to understand, there'll be another flavor of sensation in the body called confusion. If I say something that you violently disagree with, there'll be still another quality or flavor of sensation. That's coming and going, coming and going constantly. And awareness can be there. That's one possible strategy. Another possible strategy is a little bit related to that. When we interact in day-to-day life with our fellow beings, there's a lot of pleasant things that happen. When you meet a friend, you know, after the talk, okay, after this talk's over, people will come up. I know most of you will be smiling. I wouldn't advise you hug me on this particular day because of the flu thing, but on other days we might be hugging. And with that smile, with that hug, with that shaking hands, goes pleasant sensation, friendly sensation, human personality welling up within. As we attend to that, we can make an active effort both to contact that, and not only to contact that, but to sort of stay with it and spread it and foster it. So when I see somebody and I smile, there's a burst of sensation that spreads over the front part of my body. And then ripplets from that, runules, go throughout all of my limbs. That's my human warmth, my human personality spreading as part of the flow of nature. If I'm there with it, and if I make an active effort to stay with it and let it spread and manifest, then what I'm doing is I'm deepening my baseline of friendliness, of human warmth. This is called metta in the Buddhist tradition, loving kindness. And we speak of metta bhavana, B-H-A-V-A-N-A. Bhavana means development, making it grow, making it come into existence and grow. And each smile, each friendly glance, each subtle, warm, enjoyable feeling that we get just by talking with another human being, subtle as that is, that is a seed for a kind of unconditional cosmic lovingness that becomes our ground state. And that seed is watered, fostered by an active intention to keep in contact with it, to stay with it whenever it happens, to let it spread, to foster it. So there's a meditation that's sometimes done with a bell, where somebody will hit the bell and you'll listen to the initial bell, and then you'll try to stay with the after vibrations as long as you can. Some of you may have done meditations like that with sound things. Well, whenever you smile during the day, that's a bell being struck, a vibration set up, a vedana, a warm sensation, pleasant sensation, maybe in the front of the body. And there are after reverberations that stay, and if you stay with it, you'll find that that starts to sort of stick around in you and starts to color the very base of consciousness, so that there's an underlying feeling tone, regardless of how you respond to this or that situation. Sometimes you have to be strong or harsh, other times you be this way or that way, but underneath all that is a sort of the basic building block of your personality is a kind of beneficent feeling. And that can be cultivated by using as a seed all of these ordinary subtle pleasant sensations that come up in our day-to-day life. That's a whole strategy. That would be a strategy for using day-to-day life to deepen loving-kindness. And I teach this strategy to people that deal with the public, like doctors and things like that. When people come in your office, they smile sometimes, and then if they can foster that. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're supposed to go through life with a honey-sweet grin on your face. That's not what I'm saying. You learn how to more or less smile with all the pores of your skin. It's at a subtle level. And that can be a very fun meditation. It's not that meditation always has to be work. One of the things you discover as soon as you start to do Buddhist meditation is that your body is full of all sorts of subtle discomforts. Those are the limiting patterns. But you also can discover that your body is full of all sorts of subtle pleasant sensations. And those can be, by experiencing those discomforts, really acknowledging how much pain there is in these bodies and experiencing that with equanimity, that becomes the way that wisdom and purification develops. And by realizing how many subtle pleasant, warm feelings there are during the day, and by actively fostering, that becomes the seeds for the other half of meditation, which is the love, the compassion, the sort of subtle outreach of energy that we hopefully can carry with us. So, it's a whole other strategy of a sort of fostering of joyousness. And that's a fun one. What are some other strategies? There's the Zen strategy. It's interesting. In the vipassana retreats, typically we move in slow motion, like our eating is really, really slow, and the walking is really, really slow. But if you go to a Rinzai Zen retreat, you're going to get exactly the opposite. You run here, run there, run here, run there. You never have a chance to stop, literally. It's like non-stop. Well, actually, the tenor is more like, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait. Any of you that have ever done the real heavy-duty Rinzai training, like at Mount Baldy or something like that, it's got that quality to it. Well, the idea is that that can be a very powerful training, because it's sort of like real life, right? In the Rinzai Zen temple, you always have responsibilities. It's like, here, do this task real quick that you've never done before. That's the kind of thing that, you know, it's like, oh, it's terrible. They don't explain anything, right? And there's just no time. Everything is done in lockstep. And it's like, go over there and clean that meditation hall. And it's like, you don't know where anything is, you don't know where the brooms are, you don't know anything. You've got 15 minutes to do it, and you've got to go there and take care of this impossible task. And there's nobody around to explain anything to you or whatever. That's the typical thing that they do. Well, it's sort of like real life, right? Now, therein lies both the potential strength and the potential weakness of that kind of training. The potential strength is that even though it's sort of like real life, it's not really like real life, because in between these frenetic activities you're sitting for long periods of time, which you don't have in real life, and there's a whole ambiance of supporting your practice there, which you don't have in real life. Well, what you can learn is that you have to just act without fixating anything. You can literally become an activity, because the minute you stop to try to think about anything, that is to say, solidify a self doing the activity, that moment of grasping onto the past or grasping onto the future, just that moment of solidifying will get you behind the eight ball. Now, as long as you don't do that, it turns out you have just enough time to do everything you need to do, as long as you don't waste even a moment of it solidifying your moment-by-moment sense of I am doing. As soon as you do that, you're behind the eight ball. Well, it's a kind of training. And then the tenor of the training, okay, hurry up and wait. Okay, when you hurry up and rush like that, of course, remember I said that the forces that push us during the day are intimately associated with sensations. Well, now, a lot of times during the day, you just have to do things, right? You have to do this and you have to do that. You may not be able to meditate while you're doing it. You may have to just completely be that activity in the Zen way. But then there'll be a time when that activity is over, and for 30 seconds or whatever, there's sort of a dead time. Well, like the typical thing in the Zen is like that, where they make you bow, okay, it's very subtle, it's very interesting. Okay, the bows are done real quick. So they hit this, and they go, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, and you bow, and you get up again, okay? Dee, bow, and you pop up again like that. Dee, dee, and you bow, and you pop up again, and then there's like about five seconds of silence where absolutely nothing happens, like suspended motion. And then, dee, they hit the bell again. Well, you've been like trying not to be the last one to hit the floor bowing, right? Because everything has to be done real snappy, samurai style. So it's like total involvement, bowing, bowing, like that. Okay, when you get up, and there's that five seconds before they hit the bell and you do your final slow bow, in that five seconds, all of the driver sensations that were present, that may have been present, all of the drivenness in you to get these bows done, is going to percolate up to the surface in that five second interval after the intense activity. If you know that, if you know that that's the rhythm of things, you can get a five second absolute total moment of equanimity where you're ready to die, and no matter how it feels, you're just going to completely feel all that frenetic energy through, okay? And if you do that right, in that five seconds, you can get like the equivalent of a whole hour's sitting done. But you have to be, it has to be total quality, total quality. So if you don't have a lot of time to meditate during the day, there's a trade-off. Trade-offs between quantity and quality. So if you have to do a real frenetic activity, and when you stop the activity, all the frenetic driver sensations will come up in your body. If you can do a total quality thing for about five or ten seconds, if you know where to inject it during the day, and you have enough moxie, because it really takes a lot of courage to just feel through even what that feels like, you dissolve all those driver sensations, and you become very, you know, the whole practice, even though it seems to have a frenetic tenor to it, becomes, as a result of it, you just feel very cooled out and very relaxed. This is if you understand how this works. If you don't understand how this works, that Zen style of training, since it is like real life, can have the effects of real life. And you can do it, I've seen people that have done it for years, and all of them are just very driven and uptight and hyper. So one has to understand. Another Zen strategy is merging. This is something that early Buddhism did not speak too much about, although they certainly experienced it. But Zen, under the influence of Taoism, had a lot of. What is merging? Well, you totally give yourself to the activity or the person or the event in front of you, until you feel that you have become it. Now, I as an object and you as an object can never merge. As long as there's a thing called I over here and a thing called you over there, there cannot be merging. Any more than two ice cubes can come together. But you come to understand that you can experience yourself as an activity. There's an activity called me, there's an activity called you. There's a way of sinuating and vibrating and contouring that is my essence. And for each one of you, there is likewise a way of vibrating, of moving, a contour that is your essence. And when my vibration and your vibration come together, we cannot prevent them from merging. And as you're meditating from time to time, you become aware of this phenomenon. How do you become aware of this phenomenon? Well, you'll be sitting and you'll hear a sound and you'll sort of feel you have become the sound. It penetrates you through and through and you are it. Or sometimes like we have this thing here, you're sitting and meditating in the afternoon and like the ice cream truck comes by and it feels like that scratchy, hideous record and the fact that they just come around and around and around and the fact that they park, they seem to park right in front of the meditation hall. It seems like your entire being is being violated by this ice cream truck. And people typically relate to this in the usual way as like fantasies. It starts with beating up the ice cream man and then escalates into hand grenade launchers and bazookas. Okay, so that's not too wholesome level of religion. If you cut out all of that evaluating, fantasizing mind and just sit there, you'll find that your body thinks it's just going to die. When something seems to violate your being like that and if you don't think about it and just feel it, it's incredible. You're just going to explode. Your center is going to be just torn away from you. You're just going to die. But after all, it's sensation in the body and if you've had enough experience, you know how to deal with sensation in the body and you just feel that through. And there's this peak climax of excruciating intensity and then your entire being and the entire room and that sound and everything start to become like an undulating earthquake. And you feel that your being and the ice cream truck in this case are just dancing together. And there's a quality of merging and completeness and absolute invulnerability. And you're just resting and you're dancing together. It's like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. You're just sharing the same movement, the same thing, same energy. And you as an object and it as an object begin to disappear from the scene and there is simply the completeness of it as an activity and you as an activity. Now that is the sense of Samadhi in the more Hindu sense of the merging, the total merging. And you come to realize that, you know, I said we get that here with the ice cream truck. In the Zen retreats you get it in various ways, but one of the ways is by having people walk in front of you carrying sticks and things like that. It's like so much energy. It's like you're just sitting there with your eyes. You have to meditate with your eyes open, right? And you're just this vulnerable, helpless animal body that's just sitting there without thought and Darth Vader is approaching. And it's like the sensations. And then that breaks and pretty soon you are the person carrying the stick. And as they walk in front of you, you just are them and you are the whole room. You're not just that person. You're everything. As that person continues to walk, you're not even here anymore. You're just that activity. And you just go off into the universe. And there is a kind of absolute invulnerability. And that will tend to start to happen on the cushion. And then you realize that there's absolutely no reason why that can't happen with every bite of food and with every conversation, with every person that you talk to or interact with, or at least many times during the day. And you start to be able to get it off the cushion. This is merging, becoming. There's a whole lot of conceptual models that I could give to describe how and why this happens, but I'm running out of time. But it's a whole other strategy. And once you get a sense of how this is done, then that also can be a very fun thing because you see a tree and you share the activity of the tree. You see the room and you share the activity of the room. Each time you do that, you feel that your being is being expanded, getting larger and larger and larger and larger. Your capacity for life is, your elasticity is growing, growing, growing, growing, growing. When we talk about the merging strategy, a lot of people get scared because they think, won't you absorb a lot of negative energy and things like that because I walk down the streets here and what do I get to merge with? Garbage trucks and psychopathic drug dealers. But if you do it properly, merging with a saint or merging with the local druggies feels exactly the same. It just feels very clean, very clean and very complete. You always get always just the same after energy with each skillful merging. It's a whole other strategy of meditation. Again, it's more of a Zen paradigm. I'll just briefly mention another strategy. I talked about working with body sensations, talked about merging. Another strategy is working with the visual field. How is that done? Well, ordinarily when we look at things, we fixate our focus a lot. And there's a way of looking out where you let everything come in, you sort of drink it in, but you don't fixate anywhere. Do any of you know what a Gans field is? A Gans field is a visually undifferentiated realm. For example, snow and gray skies. You look out and just everything is sort of an undifferentiated gray. It's not the same as having your eyes closed. Eyes closed, the visual field turns off. A Gans field is the visual analog of white noise. White noise is like shh, that kind of thing. It's sound, but it's undifferentiated. Gans field is something visual, but undifferentiated. People find it very relaxing. Just as they find white noise you have in the dentist's office and things. People find looking at a Gans field very relaxing, much more so than closing their eyes. And it's been well documented that you produce a lot of alpha waves when you look at a Gans field. Gans field or Gansfeld is the German word for total field. Okay, by the way, there's a whole school of art that's sort of centered here in California that uses Gansfeld things to influence consciousness. If you go to the county art museum and see some of the modern art, which involves grays and shadows and things like that, that's actually meant to put you- that's consciously created to put you in alpha states. And I know several artists, prominent artists that make that kind of art. A lot of them do meditate themselves. Sort of interesting, but be that as it may. The trick, though, is to look at a visually differentiated field as though you were looking at a Gans field. And I won't go into a whole lot of detail other than to say that this is what in the Asian martial arts is called distant mountain gazing. Okay, it's like you're looking, but you're not fixated in any particular place. And what they find is that you actually take in more. The samurai used to put their lives on the line in sword fight in that state. Because, again, the idea being that if you're in front of a component that's got a weapon, your tendency is to, of course, fixate on the weapon or fixate on some part of the component. The opponent, in that instant by instant fixation of your vision, actually slows down your responses. So they would look at the whole thing at once without looking at any particular place. And then out of that would come a response. So you might think that if you start looking at the world without fixating in any particular spot, that it would make you spacey and, you know, whatever. But actually, you're able to respond better. And with this technique, as with all the other ones, you might pass through another awkward intermediate realm where you look sort of zombie-like, but you have to learn how to get over that. By the way, I know sometimes you may wonder, you know, I appear sometimes very zombie-like, and my eyes, whatever. That's not because of meditation. That's because of a thyroid condition I have. I can't do anything about it. I've got fatty deposits behind my eyes. They don't go away. Okay, these are some, as I say, some stray thoughts, some ideas about this whole issue of meditation and daily life.
