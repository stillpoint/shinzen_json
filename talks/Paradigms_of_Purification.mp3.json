{"text": " I'd like to talk a little bit more about the technology of noting and clarify a little bit of terminology for you. Any experience that we have can be divided down into components, and those components can be divided into sub-components, etc. And this, of course, is also true of the material world. One of the main things that scientists do is figure out how to divide up the pie of the external world into its natural components. And that's called analysis. The original Greek meaning of the word analysis is ana means up, and lysis means break. So analysis is to break something up into its pieces. And when you analyze it, then you can understand it. That's the endeavor of science with respect to the objective world. And the process of mindfulness can be looked upon as a kind of analysis, not in the intellectual sense of analysis, but in the literal Greek sense, that you take an experience and you divide it up into its components, sub-components, etc. And you are aware of all of those components in the moment. So it's a kind of dissecting of experience. It's interesting, the Greeks had a word analysis, but the Romans had a motto, divide and conquer. And that's exactly how Vipassana works. If you can divide an experience with awareness, the tool that you use to divide it, to dissect it, is your mindfulness. If you can divide it, then it won't conquer you. And you'll find that this is true over and over again. If an emotion comes up, and in the moment of that emotion, you are able to discern which part is idea and which part is body. Since they've broken it down into its larger two components, you'll find that you'll be less caught in that emotion if it's negative. If in addition, you can discern the individual welling and fading of the thought, and you can discern the locations, intensities, and flavors of the sensations, which is to get down to components and sub-sub-components, then you'll be caught even less. And if you can get down to the atomic strands, the tiny vibrations and undulations that are the ultimate constituent of that experience, so you're down to the sub-sub-sub-components, you won't be caught at all. This is what we mean by the word mindfulness. Mindfulness refers to all of the levels of discernment. So mindfulness could be looked upon from another perspective as heightening the resolution power. By nowadays, one of the advantages of the fact that people have computers is people know what the word resolution means. Resolution is different from magnification. A high-resolution screen gives you a very detailed picture. A low-resolution screen gives you a blotchy picture. Mindfulness could be described in a contemporary idiom as enhancing the baseline of resolution in your six senses. Instead of having a blotchy picture, you have a very detailed awareness of what's going on. Noting is the clear registering of at least the larger components. If nothing else, you are at least registering the components. That's the act of noting. For example, when you are walking, you clearly register the lifting, the swinging, and the placing. So you note the lifting, the swinging, and the placing. Now, you may also be aware of many, many smaller aspects, little movements and whatever. In other words, your mindfulness may percolate down into finer aspects of the experience. If you note at least the gross aspect of the experience, it's clearly registered. And that's called noting. In order to facilitate the noting process, you may or may not attach a label as you note. A label is a spoken or thought word, occasionally a phrase, but usually a word, that characterizes the component that you're noting. So what's the relationship between the labeling, the noting, and the mindfulness? Well, it's like if you were in a gallery, an art gallery, and you went through and you had all of these paintings. The paintings would have labels on it\u2014seascape, landscape, self-portrait. The label's not very revealing, but it calls your attention to the fact that there's a picture here. And one self-portrait might not be like another self-portrait, even though the label is the same. But when you look at the picture, you pick up the whole picture. That's the mindfulness. The relationship is that labeling is to mindfulness as a sketch is to a photograph. The labeling is very sketchy. In fact, it's more like the labeling is a caricature of what's going on. It's not very detailed, and in fact, it's not very accurate. And it doesn't have to be, because the labels, if you make them, are merely meant to be like a finger to point your attention to the picture, what's going on. And so if somebody says, hey, look at the landscape, okay, you don't look at their finger. You look over at the landscape. So in the same way, you don't want to put very much effort or attention into getting the labels to be detailed or accurate. They're just to point your attention to the fact something's going on in the knee. And now let the awareness soak down into it and detect as much as you can. But this detection is tricky, because most of what you detect you couldn't put into words. The large components you can put into words, you can say knee, you can say chest. So in other words, the things that you note are things large enough that they could be described with a word. But as you're noting an event, your awareness is picking up all sorts of stuff that's happening simultaneously, that's ineffable and indescribable. You can't possibly put it into words. Don't try. But let the resolution or the clarity of the thing that you're noting be enhanced. And that's what we mean by mindfulness. Noting is a very generic technique. We give you noting of the body sensations in terms of their locations. You could note body sensations in terms of changing intensity. You could note body sensation in terms of different flavors. An itch is different from a pressure. A pressure is different from hot. That's different from an embarrassed feeling. Those are flavors of sensation. You could note the flavors if you wanted. Or you could have heat, but it could be getting stronger, be getting weaker. You could note the changing intensity level if you wanted. But we usually start you out by noting in terms of the location. So if nothing else, you know what parts of the body are calling attention. You could also define as your object of meditation all six senses. In which case you'd be sitting and you'd be noting hearing, hearing and thinking, feeling for the body, feeling, feeling and thinking. You're letting the awareness go freely within the sensory field. Now what's the difference between that and just being distracted? Okay. What would be the difference between having your object of meditation being whatever comes up and just a state of being spaced out and distracted and going into a casual thought here and then being distracted out by the sound there? The difference is that when you note something and you are mindful of the thing you're noting, you have a moment of very intense and high concentration with the thing that you're noting. And usually concentration is thought of as holding a single small object for a significant length of time. Like you're concentrating on the sensation in your nostril and there's no distraction. There's just that for a half an hour. That's what most people think of as concentration. But there's another kind of concentration where you allow the awareness to move around, but wherever it moves to for two or three seconds, there is a momentary merging and soaking and penetrating of awareness into that object. And then it's broken and the next object arises and that is penetrated. And that is called Karnika Samadhi. Samadhi, as you probably know, means concentration, often implying a concentration so great that you become or you merge with the thing. Karna, K-H-A-N-A in Pali means a short period of time. Karnika is the adjective, so it would mean momentary. So if you have a two-second samadhi here and a three-second samadhi there and a five-second samadhi there, even though the samadhi is made and then broken, there's a make and break, make and break of this high concentration, the fact is that you get a sequence of experiences of high concentration and the net effect of that is the same as though you had held a small object without wavering for a significant length of time. And that's the whole essence of the noting technology in Vipassana. And when Mahasi Sayadaw, who developed the method of noting, was teaching this, in fact, in an early period they used to call it the Burmese method because he came from Burma, some other Vipassana teachers objected to it and they said, this is just a scattered state, you're not really teaching Samatha Vipassana, you're not teaching concentration, you're just getting people scattered. That's because they didn't understand what was meant by a sequence of momentary high concentrations. So when you are noting, you don't want to just casually note, oh yeah, that's the knee, oh yeah, that's the chest, it's like knee, you're just really with that knee and then that breaks and then there's chest and you're just really with it like that. Sometimes this practice is referred to as observing. Most Vipassana teachers talk about observing the sensation, observing the thoughts. We talk about it all the time. Actually, it's a very misleading way of talking about it, but we do anyway. Why is it misleading? Well, because it implies a self over here observing an object over there. And that's only what happens at the beginning of this practice. Early on in the practice, it is necessary to create what I call a meditating self. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't know how many of you remember when you first learned how to drive a car. I remember because I was in my 20s, it was fairly late in life. I think my late 20s. And in order to learn how to drive the car, I had to create a driving ego, a car driving ego that thought about all the different aspects of like, okay, it's like this is what I know about the steering wheel and this is what I know about the clutch and the relationship of the clutch to the gear shift and this is what I know about the relationship of the steering wheel to the mirrors, okay. And I had to keep track of all that stuff and there was a very great presence of a car driving self doing that act of driving the car. But at some point, what happened to that car driving self? Those skills became so internalized that I didn't have to have a car driving self. When I first learned how to drive the car, there was no room for anything except that car driving self. But at some point, the car driving self was completely internalized. It went on automatic pilot. And so I could have a listening to music self and still be driving the car. Or I could be listening to music, talking to a friend, you know, munching on a corn dog and driving the car. It's the same with the meditation. At the beginning, you are going to have a meditating self that's there that is, quote, observing. It's reminding you to have mindfulness and equanimity, et cetera, et cetera. And it may be making labels to help the process along. At some point, that sense of the observer has to be penetrated. Now, you don't, quote, observe the observer because then that gets you into a logical infinite regress, okay. What's really going on, even though we say we're observing, is we're actually just brightening up the picture, you might say. We're actually just pumping clarity into the hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling body, and thinking mind. We're not actually observing things. But eventually, that clarity seeps around the edges and the ideas and body sensations that give you the sense of observer start to become clarified. And then you're not sitting there observing anymore. It's a different experience. There is simply the arising of a phenomenon, and when that phenomenon arises, it's perfused with mindfulness and equanimity automatically. I wanted to just go into this so that you would understand the relationship between the labeling, the noting, mindfulness, and observing, and momentary khanika samadhi, momentary concentration. Oh, yeah, and one thing I wanted to point out. You don't have to do the labeling. Some people find that the labeling just activates too much thinking and activates too much of a sense of a self. So if you don't like to label, fine, don't label. But you may also find that if you don't label, you get spaced out, in which case, definitely label. When I was first introduced to this whole process of labeling, I didn't like it at all, and I resisted it. And maybe because I was influenced by Zen and things like that, and it seemed to me to create a dichotomy, a division between subject and object, etc. But I went along with what the teacher said. In general, when you do somebody's retreat, you should do it just the way they say. So when I went on retreats with Burmese teachers and they would have you do this, I would do it. And what I found was that eventually the labeling doesn't get in the way, and it doesn't activate the thoughts and produce that sense of self so much. But it takes a while. So you always have the option of just noting, which means just registering clearly in awareness the components of what is going on. If you do label, the way we have you label the body sensations, don't make phrases. You're not trying to describe in phrases and sentences. You don't need to put words like now or my or its. You don't have to say, you know, now the knee, now my head, or now there's an itching in my head. You just say knee, head, like that. The reason, to keep things really simple. Okay, so much for clarifying that. We say that the basic formula for how this practice works is that as you are bringing mindfulness and equanimity to the flow of experience, this engenders eventually a process of insight and purification. You know how experience has been defined, the operation of the six senses. Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body, and the thinking mind. Thinking can take place in imagery. Thinking can take place in internal conversation. Thinking can be subtle processing. The wheels are turning. You don't know exactly what you're thinking about, but the deep mind is thinking. All of these are modes in which thinking can take place. Remembering is a form of thinking. Planning is a form of thinking. Judging, fantasizing, believing, having conviction, this is the way it is, that's the way it is. Also, being confused is a form of thinking. It's muddled thinking, but it's a thinking activity. Confusion is to the mind what pain is to the body. And just as the feeling sense can be purified by experiencing discomfort with equanimity, the spiritual intelligence can be purified by experiencing confusion with equanimity. There's a whole path for developing wisdom by learning how to have equanimity with total confusion. That path is called koan study. What's the sound of one hand clapping? Don't know. The mind is stymied, it can't come up with an answer. And by being bombarded time after time after time with unanswerable questions, but with answers being demanded by your Zen master, eventually you go into equanimity with confusion and you start to channel answers. In other words, the answer is just well up of their own, and the wisdom function is being exercised and nurtured. So don't be afraid of confusion. Confusion is a great friend, just like pain, if you have equanimity with it. In other words, the state of confusion is what goads the mind to figure things out. And when you have equanimity with confusion and the mind isn't goaded to figure things out, then the intuitive or undriven function of the mind arises. And that's one way in which wisdom is cultivated. So thinking can happen in various modes, all sorts of different aspects to the thinking process. Feeling has location, it has flavor, it has intensity. So we know what feeling and thinking are. I'd like to talk at a little deeper level about insight and purification. Both insight and purification are multifaceted experiences. They can be dealt with in various ways. The word for insight or wisdom is prajna in Sanskrit, P-R-A-J-N tilde A. And jna is actually related to the English word know and the Greek word gnosis. Prajna is a kind of special knowing. Pra is actually related to the Greek and Latin pro or the English word forth. So prajna is a sort of knowing forth. It's a special kind of knowing. You can look upon this wisdom or prajna in two different ways. You can look upon it either as a mode of functioning of consciousness, which is a kind of intuitive mode. In other words, the answers sort of come. I don't mean the answers about what's going to happen in the stock market tomorrow. I mean spiritual answers, answers to the deep questions. They sort of well up. Something happens as the result of these practices in the way that the mind thinks. So one way to look at wisdom is it's a transformation in the way that the mind thinks. And basically what characterizes it is what I just described to you. When the mind doesn't need to know, doesn't feel driven to have an answer, the kinds of answers that come are the spiritual wisdom answers. From another perspective, there are different insights, different wisdoms, different knowledges that a person gets. And those can be described in words. Of course, the description in words is sort of like the description of a meal in words on a menu. You can read the menu, but it's not going to have any effect on your hunger whatsoever. No matter how long you read the menu and understand, oh yeah, I can order this, I can order this, oh yeah, this looks great, oh, I think I'd like to try this today. It's never going to have any effect on your sense of satisfying your appetite. What you have to do is you have to take a step beyond reading the menu. But I can give you a menu. I could go right down the line and talk for hours and hours about the different aspects of the wisdom experience. It's a many-faceted jewel. And different teachers at different times and in talking to different audiences would emphasize different sides of that jewel. And it can be very confusing because people might not realize they're talking about the same jewel. Early Buddhism very much emphasized the aspect of wisdom called understanding how not to suffer, regardless of conditions in life. When Buddhism developed into Mahayana and then went into China and got mixed up with Taoism and things like that, they started to talk about other aspects, aspects the Buddha didn't talk about, like merging and oneness, that kind of thing, which is more of a Taoist perception. Later on when Buddhism developed even further into the Vajrayana, they talked about insight into how the activity of consciousness creates forms moment by moment, actually understanding how, of course, they don't use the word God, they use the word emptiness. I know that for most Westerners, emptiness as an equivalent to God sounds a little strange, but every Christian mystic has said that, as has every Jewish mystic. Anyway, be that as it may, how impermanence or emptiness creates somethingness moment by moment. That's a real interesting and deep aspect of insight. And that's very much worked with in the Vajrayana tradition, where they literally create and destroy alternate universes. Talk about an advanced meditation. That's post-doctoral work. You're doing well if you could just get some insight into no-self, but when you start talking about not only understanding where the self comes from, but actually putting together and taking apart alternate selves like so many tinker toys, that's a very fascinating aspect of insight. What's interesting is the parallel between that and the Jewish mystical tradition. The pinnacle of the Jewish mystical tradition is to be able to understand, Briat yesh me'ayin, that means the continuous creation of yesh, things, me'ayin, from nothing, moment by moment, how that happens. So on one hand, wisdom is described in terms of a way of functioning of consciousness. On the other hand, we can actually go down the menu and describe aspects of the wisdom experience. On the metaphor of the person in the restaurant with the menu, what are the steps involved in going beyond reading the menu? Well, you have to place an order with the waiter, and you've already taken that, okay? You've placed your order, you've come to the retreat, you've put the tush to the kush. You're not just reading books about the spiritual path. You've actually placed an order, and you're sort of waiting for the maitre d' to bring it. By the way, after you've had your meal, and you've enjoyed all of this wonderful feast, from soup to salad, there is, of course, another step. You have to pay your bill. Do you know what that is? You've already had your meal, okay? You've gotten your insight, you've had your liberation. The wisdom faculty is there, and you're appreciating it. Do you know what it means that you have to pay for your meal? This is the way Sasaki Roshi talks. He says, after you've had a wonderful meal, you, of course, don't leave without tipping the waiter and paying. And that's all he says, okay? It's like this is how the Zen people foster the wisdom faculty. It's like, what the heck does he mean by that? It's like, you know, it's a confusion. And they won't tell you what they mean, but they say it with great conviction. He'll get up there and he'll say, after you've enjoyed your meal, you would be a real lowlife if you didn't tip the waiter deep. And he'll just get up and say something like that. And you don't, you know, it's like, what the heck is, and why is he so emphatic? Now, as I say, the Zen people point, okay, the Vipassana people explain. So, I'll explain to you what he means. It's a life of effortless service. You've got to pay the cook, okay? In God's restaurant, you've got to pay a tip. And it's not a big gratuity, okay? It's just a life of effortless service to others, what you give back for this wonderful feast that you've been able to enjoy, the spiritual feast. So, we can talk about different aspects of the wisdom experience. The aspect that I particularly like to talk about is the aspect called impermanence. And there are various reasons for that. Basically, it's the easiest to get a handle on, especially for people that aren't Buddhists. Trying to get a handle on this whole idea of no-self is, it's not appealing to people. It's emptiness, you know, it's like, you can't imagine Europeans going off, you know, like Christopher Columbus going off and saying, I'm going to conquer this new land in the name of the void, okay? That's not... But impermanence is something that, number one, is pretty obvious. And number two, impermanence is related to movement, movement is related to energy. There's a certain positive valence or a positive way that we can look upon impermanence. In fact, what the Buddhists call impermanence is very much what the Westerners called spiritus. Spirit in English, from the Latin spiritus, a translation of the Greek penuma, a translation of the Hebrew ruach. And what does ruach mean in Hebrew? Wind and breath. Something that is insubstantial but constantly moving. If we talk about insight into impermanence, you know, that sort of gives us one feeling tone. If we talk about acquiring the Holy Spirit, that gives us a very different feeling tone, but they're actually very, very related experiences. The purpose of vipassana meditation is to observe what is. Sometimes what is will present itself in terms of impermanence. And when that happens, great, go with it. You may experience things as vibratory or undulatory. Vibratory means like little bubbles or sparks or ripplings of energy. And those vibrations are very light and effervescent and effortless. And you can just sort of imbibe those qualities of lightness and effervescence if impermanence happens to present itself to you in the form of those subtle vibrations. But the purpose of vipassana meditation is not to get those subtle vibrations. We only mention it because if it happens, you can recognize it, you can use it, you can go with it for as long as it lasts. And more along the line, impermanence seems to become very permanent. Things solidify. A level of blockage comes to the surface. The body is like concrete, very uncomfortable, very rigid. Likewise, the thinking process. And don't try to go back to impermanence. Just observe that as it is. Because what we're really interested in is insight and purification. Another way that impermanence presents itself is sort of like an undulatory quality. The thing that you're observing becomes amoeba-like or like a lava lamp. It's a slower type of impermanence. In fact, impermanence exists at many, many frequencies. There are some frequencies of impermanence that are so slow that we don't really notice their waveform. The cycle of the day, for example, as the sun comes up and it gets hotter and everything gets more activated, and then as the sun goes down and you go into the night, if you graph that, it's a sine wave. And that's a very slow expansion and contraction. The cycle of the seasons is an expansion and contraction with a period of one year. Sometimes the reason that we don't detect impermanence is we're not patient enough. We are experiencing in terms of seconds and minutes, but if we had the patience of hours, days, and years, we would see very much the expansion and contraction of things. Other times we fail to detect impermanence because we can't look finely enough. The sensation seems very solid, but it's only because we don't notice the tiny fluctuations. Subtle is significant. The continents may seem very solid, but in fact, what's happening to the borders of the continents? At a fine level, at the level of grains of sand, they're constantly shifting. You just have to look at a very fine level. All of these different frequencies of impermanence ultimately can be analyzed down into two components, expansion and contraction. Now, expansion and contraction represent an abstraction from observed data. And people have trouble with abstractions. So let's make it tangible. There's nothing mystical about it. You observe a sensation and it gets stronger and it gets weaker. The fact that it's intensifying is a reflection of the expansive principle. The fact that it diminishes is a reflection of the contractive principle. Or as you watch it, its border shifts, okay? And as its border shifts to the right, it sort of bulges out on the right and it collapses a little bit on the left. It's expanding and contracting. Originally, the words expansion and contraction obviously are drawn from a spatial metaphor. That's what the words in Latin mean, expansio, contractio. Expansio means to extend in space. Contractio means to pull in, to spread out or to pull in. But they're now being used in a much more universal and general sense to refer to anything that's affirming is expansion, anything that's negating is contraction. But also any force that moves outwards is expansive. Any force that pulls inwards is contractive. You may wonder why we use these spatial terms rather than something like yin and yang or something like that. Actually, when Sasaki Roshi teaches this, he has a list of about two dozen synonyms. And he uses them completely freely. And it's like really confusing to people until you get the idea of what he's trying to do. Sometimes instead of saying expansion and contraction, he says father and mother. Or he says outside and inside. Or he says objective and subjective. Or he says life and death. Or he says affirmation and negation. Or he says future and past. Now it may not be immediately evident that all of these are exactly parallel sets of equivalents. But what's outside? Outside is something that expands in space. What's next? Next is something that expands in time. What's inside? That's something that moves in in space. What's past? Past is what happened to the present after the contractive force worked on it. Have you noticed? The present seems very big now, this present. But in two weeks, this whole scene is going to get very small. The contractive force will work on it, shrink it down. That's called going into the past. That's called becoming the past. So just as Einstein, he links the time-space continuum. What we call future is the expansive principle. What we call past is the contractive principle. What we call outside is the expansive principle. What we call subjective or inside is just the contractive. Inside you have an entire world, but it's in miniature. Everything you ever experienced. The contractive force has acted upon it and made it your subjective world as opposed to the objective world, which is the parts that you have not yet imbibed and internalized. Why do we use the words expansion and contraction when they could be a little bit misleading? Well, because ultimately what you come to realize is that time and space itself, the time-space continuum, is actually generated by these invisible movements of expansion and contraction, like foam is generated by the movement of waves. So you get a sense, the deep insight into impermanence is how impermanence molds time, space, self, and world moment by moment. And it's a deep insight. Don't expect to get it at your first retreat or your tenth retreat. You might get hints of it. But, you know, one of the nice things about this path is there's always something to look forward to. When I listen to my teachers talk, some of the things they say I understand very, very clearly, crystal clear. Other things that they say I understand sort of, darkly, you know, through a glass darkly, sort of, yeah, that sort of makes sense. Other things that they say make no sense whatsoever, even though I've meditated by Western standards for a long time. There's things Sasaki Roshi says that there's just no light turns on at all in my head. It's like, what? I just don't get that one at all. But I know one of the nice things about having meditated for 25 years is I can look back and I can see, obviously, the first time I heard a master speak, I didn't understand anything. And in fact, I thought they were just making it up. I was just like, okay, you know, this is one of these things that they're just making up to blow people's minds. And not only did I not understand it, I thought it was BS. As the years have gone on, five years passed, and at the five-year point, I understood some things. And I call those five-year insights. And they were very valuable. In fact, if I had a choice of having the five-year insight, and it would cost me my life, it would be well worth it. It would be a small price to pay. But the neat thing is that there's 10-year insights. Things your teacher said that it took 10 years to finally, uh-huh, yeah, it makes perfect sense. They couldn't say it any other way. Why did it take me this long to catch on? And then there's the 15-year insight, the 20-year insight. You know, I don't know whether insight into how impermanence molds time, space, self, and world for you is going to be a five-year insight, a 10-year insight, maybe a 20-year insight. So, as you're paying attention to phenomena, sometimes the best you're going to be able to do is have some minimal contact with the phenomenon, some minimal mindfulness. If you can do that, that's good. That's fine. Even after meditating many, many years, if a lot of stuff is coming up from the inside or you're facing a very challenging circumstance on the outside, the best you may be able to do is just be aware that your glasses are on your nose and your feet are in your shoes. Or you're driving your car and you can feel the steering wheel. And that may be about the best you can do if you've got some really big upset in your life. I call that just a minimal mindfulness. As opposed to what? As opposed to being just totally spaced out and totally in abject confusion and suffering. The best you may be able to do is just some minimal contact with reality. And that might not seem like much, but that's fine. That's fine. Other times, you can have really significant contact with what is. For example, if you're going through an emotion, it may be that the best you can do, it's a big emotion, a big upset, a major issue in your life, maybe the best you can do is just be aware that there's a lump in your throat. Okay, that's minimal contact. That's okay. That's a start. But it may be that in addition to minimal contact, you can have really significant contact. You can feel not only the lump in your throat, but how it's sending out subtle ramifications that are expanding and contracting and vibrating through your whole body. So you have really significant contact with the phenomenon. Good. In addition, sometimes you will have a minimal contact with impermanence. You're aware of a sensation, it's in your knee, it gets a little stronger, gets a little weaker. One might say, so what? So what? That's trivial. But at least there is some contact with impermanence, minimal as it may be. Other times, you may have significant contact with impermanence. Significant contact with impermanence, well, shall we talk about the most significant contact with impermanence? The most significant contact with impermanence is that you participate in the movements of impermanence that moment by moment are creating the self and the world. You co-create the self and the world along with the activity of the source. I can give you a metaphor. It may seem like an exceedingly strange metaphor for what this is like. The way we might conceive of creation in our ordinary human anthropocentric or human-centered way of looking at things is you have a lump of clay and somebody molds that clay into some form. In fact, that's a metaphor that appears a lot in myths and spiritual literature around the world. God sort of is like these giant cosmic hands that mold this clay into form. This metaphor breaks down in several ways. It's incomplete in several ways. First of all, the clay dries and there you've got this thing, except are you the same as you were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 40 years ago? Will you be the same in 10 years? Obviously, you're not a piece of dried clay. The molding is continuous. First, you have to imagine that the molding is continuous. God is constantly tweaking, pulling out here, pushing in there a little bit. How did you get a face? Generally, it's expansive. You've got a globe here. But there had to be some contraction, the eye sockets, the ears. But then around that contraction, there's a little more expansion. The nose expands out. The mouth contracts in. That's going to change as time goes on also. There's a kind of continuous molding that's going on. You have to get rid of the idea that it dries. The next thing you have to get rid of is the idea that there's a material substance called the clay. The next thing that you have to get rid of is the idea that there are material hands. Then what are you left with? You're left with the pure activity of molding. It expands here, contracts there, expands here, contracts there. Within that activity of molding, when that activity of molding gets frozen in our consciousness for a moment, then we get the sense of a thing. But if we just allow the activity of molding to continue, that thingness immediately disappears, and we go back into the pure movement of the molding. Another metaphor might be how the birthing process takes place. The womb expands and contracts, expands and contracts, expands and contracts. After it's done enough of that, something comes into existence. But of course, God's womb is formless. It's immaterial. The things that come into existence are reabsorbed back moment by moment. This is what we might call really significant contact with impermanence. Once you have that kind of contact with impermanence, you're never going to be bored. You may hear stories like they say Bodhidharma looked at a wall for nine years. That was one of the Zen patriarchs. That sounds awful boring. Why would somebody want to look at a wall for ten years? But of course, if you were experiencing that wall and yourself being formed and reabsorbed moment by moment from the source and then back to the source, you would never be bored with that activity of sitting and facing a wall any more than God's bored with the activity of creating the world. Sometimes you may be able to have really significant contact with impermanence, and then you can't have that significant contact anymore. In fact, you have no contact. The best that you can do is just be aware that your glasses are on your eyes and your feet are in your shoes. And that's okay. That's how this path works. So this is something about the aspect of insight, specifically that facet of insight called insight into, quote, impermanence. What about purification? What do we mean by purification? Well, there is a flavor or a taste that is very difficult to describe to people. But we can say that it's an acquired taste. You know how when you were a kid, you didn't have a mature palate? Things that tasted good to adults didn't taste good to you. And you couldn't understand why adults even liked those things. But as your palate gets older, as you get older, actually your taste for things changes. Well, there's a taste that is acquired by people as they get spiritually older, as they mature. And it's the taste of purification. And I can't put it into words, but many of you have had this experience. A pain will arise, and you'll have equanimity with it, and there'll be a kind of good feeling that is associated with having that uncomfortable feeling in a very skillful way. And what that good feeling is is a sense that every moment of your life to come is going to be more fulfilling and freer because of the way that you experience this present moment. It's a sense that the substance of your being is being cleaned out. And once you get a sense for this taste of purification, your practice proceeds very easily because if you can have pleasant experiences, good. But if you can't, then you experience the deprivation, true, but you also experience some of that taste of purification in your deprivation. Likewise, if you can avoid pain, good. But if you can't, while you're experiencing the pain, you get a little bit of that taste of purification. And so you sort of have your cake and eat it too. And that's one, that taste of purification is one of the aspects that makes this path very joyous. You know, if your friends were to come and look at you here just sitting, you know, sort of like a zombie, they might think that there's no joy in this path whatsoever. Everybody's like, you know, you're sort of almost like, you know, your face is like, I call it the Zen deadpan. It's like, okay. It doesn't seem like there's any joy at all. But actually, people are so busy, people that have meditated for a long time, are so busy enjoying that taste of purification moment by moment as they're sitting, that they have no time to express it on their face. Okay. And if that seems strange, if you think about the other very, very intense form of joy that human beings experience, most of them, you know, a couple times a week, and if you remember Woody Allen's remark about it being the most fun that you can have without smiling or laughing, then you'll understand that certain kinds of joy are so deep that you don't smile or laugh. Okay. And the taste of purification is definitely like that. So don't be fooled by that seeming Zen deadpan or seeming non-joyousness of the advanced Buddhist meditator. Okay. They're having, you know, it's the same thing. It is definitely the most fun that you can have without laughing. Okay. Just as the insight process can be looked upon in different ways, the purification process can be looked upon in different ways. And we're used to this in science. You can have different descriptions of the same reality. Einsteinian physics doesn't obviate the need to learn Newtonian physics. Okay. They just deal with the same physical world but from a different perspective. One way that you can look upon purification is from a psychological paradigm. It's one that we're pretty used to. We have holdings from the past. We have negative conditionings. We have experiences that weren't completely digested. We have internal conflicts in our structure. And those psychological blockages or problems or holdings or engrams or imprints, whatever you want to call them, they come up. They come up as ideas and beliefs. They come up as body sensations, sometimes very strange body sensations, icky, sticky, creepy, crawly. Sometimes for some people they come up as very vivid imagery, archetypical imagery sometimes of sex and violence. They come up in different ways. So we observe them with mindfulness and equanimity. We don't reinforce them. And as the result of that, they work their way out and we become healthier. That's a psychological way of looking at it. If that paradigm works for you, fine, use it. Another way, we can use a theological paradigm. This one is not too much in style in the West now, but I think it has a validity. There's this thing that separates us from our source. The English word is sin. And it takes the form of our cravings, our aversions, our hatreds, our fears, our neediness, our egocentricities, et cetera, et cetera. Now, in truly primitive religion, one loves God and hates sinners. The sinners in this case could be others, like some other tribe, who are the sinners, or it could be ourself. We hate ourself for our impurities. So that's truly primitive religion. When religion evolves a little bit, you reach the point where you love God and you love the sinners, but you still hate the sin. Then when religion evolves a little further, you come to the point of realizing that hatred is a form of sin. It's aversion. So then what are you going to do? Then you reach a point of maturity where you understand how to love sin to death. And that's called the process of observing with equanimity the stuff when it comes up. You literally love it to death. Equanimity is exactly synonymous with love. Love means a hands-off attitude. You don't need to push and pull on your lover in any way. You let your lover dance his or her dance without needing to influence it in any way, at least upon occasion. And that's called the moment of true love. And when you do that with your, quote, sinfulness, you are in the process of loving it to death, because you're not reinforcing it. You're not identifying with it, which would be to feed it. Neither are you pushing it away, which also feeds it. You put ego energy into it when you try to reject it. So that attitude of sober... In the Christian tradition, they called it nepsis, N-E-P-S-I-S, or nu etta pi sigma iota sigma. It would be written in the Greek. And nepsis is usually translated as sober observation. That was one of the main practices in the Eastern Orthodox Catholic tradition. And that's basically loving the sin to death. And it's basically what vipassana is about. So if you want to look upon purification in this way... And by the way, the words that they use for purification in Christianity is catharsis, from the Greek root katharein, which means to cleanse or to clean out. And it was translated... Again, the Romans just copied the Greeks. Whatever the Greeks did, they copied. So all the Greek words, they translated into Latin. So catharsis was translated as purgatio. And that's what gives us our word purgation or purgatory. And also, it's related to the root of purification. So if you want to look at purification that way, from a sort of moral theological point of view, that's fine. If you want to look from a psychological paradigm, that's fine. There are other paradigms. Maybe you don't like religion at all. Maybe you're a very secular scientific type. There are some rather nice parallels from the physical world that could be analogs for the process of purification. You can use a mechanical model. Mechanical systems are subject to friction forces. And the friction forces do three things. They produce heat, they dissipate energy, and they can warp the system. And we're subject to something like an internal friction force in constant ways that we're not aware of. We're interfering with the flow of our six senses, here, holding there, pushing here, pulling there, microscopically, without even knowing it. Or fluid systems. You can use mechanical systems or you can use fluid systems. Fluid systems, there's two ways that a substance can flow. There's what's called laminar flow, and then there's what's called turbulent flow. And turbulence is a sort of fluid friction phenomenon. It's not exactly the same. It's eddies, and it's actually a very interesting phenomenon. Each age has had its own model or paradigm for what consciousness is. And it's always whatever is the state-of-the-art technology of that age. Back in the ancient times, the earliest model was the Chinese model, which is consciousness is a fluid system, like the water channels and aqueducts going to the paddy fields. That was the technology of China. The height of their technology 3,000 years ago was that they were able to get these great irrigation systems going. So consciousness is analogous in that time to an irrigation system. It's a hydrodynamic model of consciousness. Later on, in the 19th century in Europe, another hydrodynamic model was used by Freud. Freud looked upon the thing in terms of it's like a steam engine, which is based on the thermodynamic, which was what was developing in his time. Of course, nowadays, everybody's convinced that consciousness is either like a computer or it's like a hologram or whatever the state-of-the-art is. Oh, and in the 16th century, when Europeans developed the lens systems, and they had the microscopes and the telescopes with the going thing, and everybody was impressed by them, the consciousness was some sort of a very elaborate optical system that somehow focused this light. That's what Leibniz thought consciousness was. Well, anyway, each age uses whatever its state-of-the-art is as a metaphor. So if you want to think of consciousness the way 19th century Europeans did, as some sort of engine, then purification is eliminating the friction in the engine. And as you get less friction, of course, the engine functions more efficiently. But much more important than that, you don't produce the heat called suffering, and you don't get warping of your perceptions and behaviors. You become optimally efficient. So if you want to use that metaphor, fine. Personally, I like the older metaphor for consciousness, the hydrodynamic model, that it's like an irrigation system with water flowing through channels. And the idea is to get laminar flow and to cut down turbulence and viscosity. There's a certain viscosity in the flow of our senses, and the viscosity is so great that it appears that our senses don't flow. It appears that they're very rigid. Now here's an interesting question. I know I'm going a little over, but it'll just take me a minute to finish. You all know what viscous means? Motor oil is more viscous than water. Molasses is more viscous than motor oil. Do you know what the most viscous common substance is? Somebody just said it. Huh? Glass. Glass. The glass windows. They are so viscous that we think that they're absolutely solid and crystalline. But actually, glass is a fluid, believe it or not. If you don't believe it, if you go to Europe, where they have very, very old buildings, and look at the windows, you see they're thicker on the bottom than on the top. Gradually, that window is melting. And given enough time, it would just flatten out like an ice cream cone and just drip out onto the surface. But it takes a long time because it is very viscous. Okay. Our senses are so viscous that we think that they're crystalline and solid. And the breaking up of the internal friction, the viscosity, and the going from turbulent to laminar flow, that is a completely secular, physical description of the purification process. Now, I know it might not seem that something as theological as, you know, being cleansed of your sin, and something as completely mechanistic as lubricating an engine, these don't seem to be related, but there are different ways of describing the same process. Now, if you want to be very much in the contemporary metaphor and look upon consciousness as some sort of computer or data processing channel, then purification becomes eliminating noise in the system, increasing the signal to noise ratio. When you're being mindful, your information channel is getting so wide, so many bits are coming through, that it crowds out all the noise. Okay. And you're just left with what is. So, if you want to use computer jargon, you can say that the purification is eliminating noise in the system or learning how to have the optimal baud rate, which is the density of data flow as a function of time is called the baud rate. So, that's like a real secular description of the process of purification. So, feel free to pick your metaphor. Whatever works for you. The important thing is to do the process. And why? Why do we do this process? If you find yourself wondering, why am I doing this? You can answer the question very quickly, very simple. You're doing this for two reasons. One is called yourself and the other is called others. For you as an individual to have an optimally happy life is why we do this, why we are in the process of insight and purification. But that's only exactly one half of what this whole path is about. If it were just that, that's an unbalanced spirituality. We're also doing this for others so that we can be optimally in the service of others. So, that's something to keep in mind so that you get a sense of balance and you realize that this isn't just a selfish activity that, oh, I'm purifying consciousness so that I can be happy. When consciousness is purified, when you are no longer a rigid particle, then you become an interactive wave and you experience a larger identity and therefore, very naturally, you experience a larger sense of activity, a larger sense of endeavor to help your larger being. So, when the mind-body process is purified, what that means is that it now has become transparent and it can channel the love of the source. It's no longer opaque. The love can come from the source out into creation and you're just sort of channeling it through your mind-body process.
