{"text": " But by the way, I would encourage, because if you say, well, you know, there's this or that, but I found this teacher that, that's a big laying a trip on people, okay? That is definitely a major laying of trip whenever it's centered around the personality of a teacher. But I can tell you how to get out of that. It's very simple. Instead of even mentioning the teacher by name or even alluding to the fact there is a teacher, you can say something like, okay, so let's say you say teacher. I found somebody that seems to communicate the practice very logically and scientifically, and I like that. And then you give them your tapes, that's what I would do. Yeah, or, right, but you don't, but I would really, this is a little bit of a tangent, but since it came up and we're talking about teaching, personally, if you want to do me a favor, don't, a big personal favor, don't have in the back of your mind that you found this great teacher. I don't talk about it quite that way. This guy, you wouldn't believe it, he's not like a real Buddhist teacher. He's like a physicist and he talks about it in science class. But even that, see, that's still, well that's good, but that still brings in the aspect of I found this guy. What you want to do is, you can say the same thing, subtle is significant. You can convey, what you're really trying to convey is not that you found this guy. What you're trying to convey is that you found an approach that works for you. And now that's very legitimate to convey, but what you have to do, if you want to do me a personal favor, is extract that approach from the guy that's giving that approach. First of all, because some other people, quite different backgrounds might be using similar approaches. And secondly, let's get away from, see this is an archetypical thing. It is probably hardwired in our nervous system to deify our teachers. Just like we deify our lover at some level. Now I'm using deify with a wide range. You notice now I'm clarifying my meaning. Ah, what I'm talking about. I'm using it metaphorically. You may not literally deify your teacher in that you have on an altar with etc. etc. But we tend to think in those subtly idolatrous ways about the person that has given us. And it's just a tendency in the human mind. I think it's because it's a very intimate connection to a teacher. You're allowing that person to make changes within you. I can't imagine anything more intimate. Because it's like midwife, lover, and undertaker all rolled into one. It's like everything. It's like the whole thing. Plus maybe therapist. It's like everything. That person is teaching you to be completely alive and completely dead. This is the most awesome thing that anybody can convey to another person. So we tend to consciously or unconsciously put a lot on. And then it comes out in our vocabulary. And then it leads to... You don't like having the trips laid on you. But if you say I finally found a teacher that. Then they're already... I don't like the idea of that. But what I would say is just don't refer so much to an individual. Say I finally found an approach that really works for me. And this is the approach. It's very logical. It doesn't accept anything on faith. But it does involve intensive cultivation of basic skills and observing yourself. So now you've communicated. You've communicated what you want to communicate. I'm not an airy fairy. I'm a rationalist kind of person. But I'm into something that really involves work and really involves change. You've communicated everything you wanted to communicate. Without throwing in the hint of that little red herring of. I finally found somebody that could lead me or teach me. You have not alluded to a person. You've alluded to an approach. It comes up when they say how can you be silent for six days? Don't you ever get to talk? And I say yeah, you get to have an interview with the teacher. So then the whole issue comes up about the teacher. And please don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say this guy. That's my way to downplay it. I like the this guy. No. That's what I want to hear. I have to downplay it. Because older people will think well what's her deal? She's laying some trip on me and that's her thing. And I don't really want to be a Buddhist. People get into their stuff. So I really do get into just. That's right. And if you want to avoid the teacher word, you can say the leader. The group leader. Something like that. Just a comment. I've run into that problem many times. And what I've done in those kind of social situations is to just directly turn to them and say. Well how interested are you really in hearing about this? Because you were talking about not wanting to go deeply and get vulnerable. And some people they'll look at you and say well I'm really interested. And I'll often say well then talk to me later because I can really tell you about it when you're not in a crowd. That's very good. I will also do that. That's a standard strategy. And they'll say well I just kind of want to know a little bit about it. Then it's like okay then you can kind of give a general thing like you're talking about without referring to the teacher. But also in Boulder without referring to even the teaching. The way that because people are so trip sensitive and methodology sensitive. I find that the best way to do it is to just talk about what it's done for me. It's like well I don't want to really tell you. If you're really interested in it I'll tell you about it later. But let me tell you what it's done for me. And that really gets people like well that's interesting. It sparks their interest even further. That is absolutely correct. Of course we're sort of going in various directions at once but that's okay. Because the point that you just brought up is something that I usually bring up on the talk on teaching days. Which is one of the least invasive ways to go about talking about this practice to people. Is to say well this is what I do when such and such happens. And this is how it's worked for me. Then you're not implying that they have to do it that way or you know. I had an interesting thing just to tell you a little anecdote. The fellow that I hope that I can get to come as a facilitator next time I come. He had a thing where he never had very good communication with his father. And then his father started to go through the dying process. And this happened right after I gave that Thanatos and Eros talk. Some of you I think were there. That was probably the heaviest, most amazing night of public talk that I ever gave. But as you can tell by the title it's a talk about love, sexuality, death. And specifically it has my methodology for working with the dying in it in an outline form. And he had been there for that talk or got a hold. Maybe he got a hold of the tape. I can't remember. But anyway you know just as is always the case a few weeks after I've talked about it. It's like now it's right in his face. His father's dying. So I worked with him. He listened carefully to that tape. He is trained as a facilitator of course for a number of years. But I also consulted with him in working with his father. And he ended up actually, I mean I don't want to give you the wrong impression that it works out this way even most of the time. This was definitely three standard deviations from the mean. But he ended up bringing his father to classical enlightenment. And this is starting from speed zero and a lifetime of no communication over a period of, yeah, I mean totally amazing. And it changed the whole family. You know, would that it could always work that way. And then his father died. Yeah, died that way. His father must have been very open to that. Well his father had never been open to shit their whole lives. That was, they had had the classical, you know, not very happy family situation. Been there, done that. And this was the particular flavor thereof known as the Jewish dysfunctional family. And he literally, you know, from no communication and his dad spiritually at zero velocity, you know, harnessing the energy of the intensity of the dying process to basically the father giving satsang to the hospital staff. Now of course it doesn't always, that's the ideal. That's what we're working for in depth coaching. So it can happen. But one of the things that we talked a lot about was, well, how is he going to get his dad, you know, how is he going to communicate with him or get him at all interested because there's just this history of no communication about anything. So one of the things that was hit upon that really did work is, you know, if he goes up and says, dad, try this. No. Okay. But when the window of opportunity is there, okay, the father has physical pain, fear. Well, you know, dad, when I have pain, this is what I do. When I have physical pain like what you have now, this is what I do. And then describe specifically. I focus on it this way, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So now you're talking about what you do. You're not saying, you know, you got to do it. And you're describing in lucid terms what you do so they can see it. Well, yeah, I can sort of see that that might work. And then if they want to go for it, fine. And if they don't want to go for it, that's fine. It's a very noninvasive way of proselytizing, if you will. And that's what he used. And then, you know, there was enough interest events that, you know, he could, you know, take him, give him some things and whatever. Part two, I think, is in the zeitgeist notions and this fascination with other people's experience. And this current fascination with memoir and biography. People are ready and anxious to hear about other people's experiences. It's a really good place, I think, to start. I think there's a way to expand to talking from our own experience. Because I talked to my mother yesterday, and she's always making jokes about me going to those retreats. It's like, that's Jewish humor. Diminished, but you don't understand. Yeah, that's a coping mechanism, right. So yesterday, I just got real straight with her. And I can't say I don't suffer anymore or, you know, that I know how to work with my pain. But what I did, from a really honest, sincere place, is say, I'm tired of suffering. I mean, I could talk about where I, why I'm motivated to even pursue the path. Even though I'm not having the experience that I would like to have. But her dog just died. She suffers a lot physically. So I was just really able to say, you know, people are going to die, dogs are going to die. You know, I've been in a lot of pain a lot of the time. And here's why. I go to these retreats. And she really got very quiet. I could feel it. She heard it in a very different way. So you can talk about what motivated us. I'll tell you an interesting story. One of Sasaki Roshi's oldest, maybe his oldest student, her name is Prabhasadharma. I don't know if any of you ever heard of her. She used to be called Geschen. That's a sign of a Japanese name. Anyway, she's German. And she went back to Germany and she was interviewed on German television about the Zen practice. And the interviewers, I don't remember exactly, but I'm paraphrasing. The interviewer said, well, you don't seriously believe that the people of Germany would ever, you know, take on this Zen practice, do you? And she said, what do you mean? Every single person in this country is doing it right now, whether they know it or not. They're already. Oh, no, the question was, you don't think that they'll ever be Buddhist, that the Germans will ever become Buddhist, do you? And she said, what do you mean? They're already Buddhists. Everyone here is already a Buddhist. Okay, and it just stopped him in his tracks. What she meant was that whether people are aware of it or not, if they're participating in life, they're participating in the Dharma. And what that means is that if you are sensitive to the window of opportunity, they will, they meaning just about anybody you interact with, at some point will open the door. And if you're sensitive, you know, in Greek there's two words for time. There's chronos, which means the duration of time. And there's kairos, which means a point in time, particularly a magic point in time when it's just the right time to do something. That's called the kairos. And with just about anybody, if you have a long-term interaction, there's going to be a kairos. There's going to be a moment when the fact that they're doing Dharma practice without knowing it is going to come to the surface. And if you go for it right then, you'll get right in. So the idea is to realize, you know, that they're already Buddhist, Hindu, Advaita, whatever word you want to use. They're already doing it, whether they know it or not. And so they'll tell you something, or there'll be the right time. For my friend's father, the right time was when he completely had the rug pulled out from under him physically and emotionally. I mean, just completely this is it. This is the big one. The brain's not working, the body's not working. That was the time that he was ready to consider breaking the limited identity with the brain and the body. I'll tell you another anecdote. Some of you may have heard this one. I have an aunt that lives in New York, and she only comes out to California a couple weeks in the winter each year to get a little respite from the East Coast weather. So for my whole life, every winter I would always meet this aunt and we'd go out with my family for a bagel brunch. It was like a ritual thing. This was a person that I always dreaded these obligatory bagel brunches with my aunt from Manhattan because it was like I had nothing in common with this person. She was to me the avatar of conventionality, the very embodiment of an East Coast snobbery with no intersection between her life interests and anything I was interested in. But I'd always have to go, so I learned to endure these things. And this went on year after year after year, and so it's okay. But in my mind, she was the icon of somebody that I couldn't communicate with, so I had to sort of watch my sensations or something. So a couple years ago, okay, comes out and we go out for our bagels, and it's with my mom. Oh, by the way, I had told this aunt what I did for a living was teach Asian languages. That was the closest I wanted to get to what I actually did. And it wasn't entirely a lie because in those days I did also sometimes teach Asian languages. But I didn't want to say, you know, I teach meditation. Okay, she can understand I'm a linguist, and that's as far as she's going to stretch into my world. Okay, so we go out to lunch, and it's like we're talking, and I don't know, somehow the topic of death came up. And out of nowhere, she pops up with, well, I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid at all to die because actually I know exactly what happens when you die. I died. I was on the operating table, and I could hear the surgeons say, you know, that I had died. And I floated up into the air, and I looked down, and I realized I was dead, and everything was completely peaceful, and I wasn't scared at all, and it was very pleasant. And then I saw this white light, and I started to go into this light, and it's a classic near-death experience. And ever since then, I've known exactly what happens, and I'm looking forward to it. I'm not afraid at all. That's like just out of left field, right? So I said, so Kairos, okay, 20 years I've known this woman. I've known my whole life I've known this woman. For 20 decades, the window is right there, okay, staring me in the face. So the right thing to say, the perfect thing to say, you can put yourself in my situation. What do you think you'd say? I said what I consider to be the absolute perfect thing because you will encounter people that have had classic near-death experiences, and it's been positive for them. I said you'll be asked questions by different kind of people. Okay, well, one of the kinds of people that will ask you a question is somebody that has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. So how do you respond to that kind of person? Well, she's not the first person or the 10th person or the 100th person that I have talked about meditation to who has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. I've had lots and lots of chances to figure out, what do you say to these people? So here's what I said. I said, imagine what it would be like to be able to live ordinary life in that state. Okay, and she said, oh, that would be wonderful. So what do you say next? Okay, it's balls to the wall. It's all out. That's what I teach people how to do. That's what I do with my life. I teach people how to live their life in that state. Oh, really? Do you have any literature about that? Which language do you use? Do you have any literature about what you teach? There it was. It is absolutely a chess game. I don't play chess, but I saw that movie In Search of Bobby Fischer, and that was enough to give me an idea of what chess was about. And communication is a chess game, but the enemy is not the person you're communicating with. The enemy is breakdown in communication, and you're trying to defeat the enemy called breakdown in human communication. And it is absolutely a game of strategy. Okay, that's how I conceive of it. If I'm in a debate with a born-again Christian, the enemy is not the born-again Christian. The enemy is, why the fuck can't we communicate? Okay. And it takes a long, it may take decades. I didn't want to say that to him. No. Yeah, but once you've been in that world, it's so much easier. I mean, you have to understand the other person's world. I grew up in that. That's right. I used to talk to my family. My dad, last time I was there, showed me passages in the Bible that might prove reincarnation. It was the first time he ever considered it. A lot of early Christians believed in it until it was politically made a heresy. But, see, there is an enemy, okay? It's called why we can't communicate. And it may take decades to learn how to defeat that enemy. And it's a matter of honing your strategy and honing your strategy. And as Linda correctly pointed out, most of it is figuring out where the other person is coming from. And having a deep human empathy for that person. A desire, as we say, that that person be happy too. Because if you're talking with somebody that is pinning their entire existence on some myth, okay, and you're in a position of popping that myth, you also have to realize what a threatening thing that is for that other person. And take that all into consideration when you're interacting. You have to care about the person that you're debating. If you know the myth, though, you use the myth. You just use the myth. Other people might benefit from this. That's why I'm going to ask it. But I have someone that I've been working with. And I experienced that and a total communication breakdown over a period of time. And it was about meditation. And at one point, it was like, look, I'm feeling good. And my feeling good is based on circumstantial evidence or just consequences. The fact that life is good right now. Why should I go into, like, exploring pain or, you know, going into emotional space? Like even listening to some of your tapes. You know, it's like, why do this? When right now I think, why would you want to take away my present moment? And I've, you know, come back and said, well, because there's going to be a moment when your present moment isn't going to be this good. And, you know, you might want to have some skills and some ground. Right, and it doesn't get anywhere, right? Okay, Brian, I got a suggestion. Think out of the box. You know the expression, think out of the box? Instead of where the hitch is there, maybe that you're thinking too much about the side of meditation that is the reduction of suffering. Maybe, maybe you want to think about some of the other sides of meditation that that person would deem more relevant to their situation. I've heard this retreat about myself, that I don't typically think about the pleasure points. Right, for example, I'm not saying that this is the answer to that particular communication breakdown, but see that's the thing about the Dharma. One of the monasteries in Tibet is called Gomang. Okay, go means window, and mang means many. Many windows. Okay, and they named that monastery many windows, not just because it had a lot of windows in it, but as a whole metaphor for the teaching process. There's just a lot of windows you can enter through with people. And you don't want to get too fixated on one of those windows. Yes, indeed, transcendence of suffering is important. And in your particular case, and in the case of many people, myself included, it's the main, was at least the initial motivation. But there's lots of other windows. For example, if I was engaged in this, and that just didn't do it. You know the expression, maybe you don't know, hakminit kainchainik? It means just... This is a Yiddish expression that you cannot translate into English. The people that are laughing are the ones that use this expression. Well, that's pretty damn close. Well, the chainik part is Russian, but the rest is German. Hakminit kainchainik means... Well, actually, it's pretty close. No, actually, what it means is stop banging on the tea kettle. In other words, get off it. Okay. Hak means to bang. It's cognate to English, hak. It literally means don't bang the chainik, the tea kettle, for me. So hakminit kainchainik. In other words, what you're doing is, transcending of suffering is a big aspect for you. You're banging away on this tea kettle. But it's not what they're interested in. But what you can do is think of some other things that they might be interested in. For example, you're feeling great. By developing your focusing abilities, you can intensify and prolong those pleasant sensations. Maintain them under circumstances where they tend to go away. So you're feeling good. Okay, but have you ever noticed sometimes you feel better and sometimes you notice fluctuation? Well, the meditation will allow you to hold more the good ones. That might be a possibility. Yeah. Basically, we're creatures of a mind and body. So the basic motivations that people are going to have is they've got something going on in their body. And it could be pleasant or it could be unpleasant. It could be of emotional origin or it could be of physical origin. Think of those basic categories, okay? That covers a lot of human experience. Or they've got something going on in their mind, okay? If they're experiencing pleasant sensations of physical or emotional origin, they would like those sensations to be deeper and more fulfilling. If they're experiencing unpleasant sensations, which are either physical, emotional, or both, they would like those sensations to give them less suffering. Well, that covers a pretty wide range of motivations to get involved in the practice, and that's just the body. For the mind, people would like to understand who they are. They would like to understand what their spiritual source is. So what window are you going to enter from, okay? Enter from emotion, body sensation. Enter from physical body sensation. Enter from pleasant. Enter from unpleasant. Or if you don't enter from the body, enter from the mind. They want to understand something about how their sense of self arises, oneness, separateness, directly experiencing their spiritual source, as opposed to a talk, image, and feel reflection of the spiritual source. That's a lot of gates. Concentration and intelligence. Yeah, I mean, you know? So the breakdown in the communication there was because you were seeing very big the facet that was important for you. Which is a facet that's important for a lot of people, but not everybody. Right, but not necessarily that person, so yes. So now you learned some Sanskrit. But I was still stuck on it. But eventually this will be important. So I was still, you know, stuck on it. That's right. And that may be true, but not useful in the moment. The Buddha said, he described his teaching in the following terms. He said there are things that are true, there are things that are useful. And he said this, he was such a modern person in some ways. Such a modern person in certain ways, and in other ways very much limited by his time and culture.
