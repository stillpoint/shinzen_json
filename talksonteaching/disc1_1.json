{"text": " major spiritual traditions can basically be analyzed in terms of two fundamental components. There's work that we do on ourself, for ourself, and then there's what we put out in the world. And the interplay between these two components is a major theme all over the world. First, Dominic said that what Christianity was about, as far as he was concerned, was contemplating and giving to others the fruits of contemplation. In early Buddhism, they speak of liberation on one hand, but they also talk about the divine abodes, the Brahma-viharas, which are these positive states of love, compassion, and so forth. In Mahayana Buddhism, of course, it's very developed prajna and karuna. And in Vajrayana, the third Buddhist tradition, they speak of prajna on one hand and upaya. Upaya is actually a very rich term in Sanskrit, but one of the meanings is ways of reaching out to people. So there is this dynamic between these two sides. In the Hindu tradition, one speaks of the work one does on oneself, for oneself. It's called sadhana, S-A-D-H-A-N-A. And then what one does for others, what one puts out into the world, is seva, or service. One aspect of the seva, or service, is, quote, teaching. But I like to think of teaching from a very broad definition. Usually when we think of teaching, we think, well, somebody has classes, they run sittings, they run retreats, they give public talks, they have people that study with them in a formal way as students. We tend to think of that as teacher. But what I would like you to do is think of that as only one particular facet of this more generic aspect of teaching. And what I did was, I made this diagram which describes three concentric domains of teaching. The idea being that the central one, and I'll explain what I mean by these terms, what's at the center, subtle teaching, is the most fundamental and necessary for the other two. And then there's conceptual teaching, and you have to be able to understand its principles in order to do experiential teaching. So let me explain what I mean by this. Anybody that practices meditation does subtle teaching, just by the fact that you practice it. What you exude to others from your state of consciousness subtly teaches people. And also what they observe in terms of the changes that they see in you over periods of time, that is a profound teaching. When we make inquiries with first-timers at our vipassana retreats, inquiring what brought you to this practice, there are two most common answers. It's a bimodal distribution, statistically. There are two answers that are very common. One answer is that, on their own, they had simply discovered things like mindfulness, but had not had a vocabulary for it, and did not realize that there was a formal way to enhance it. They just sort of hit upon it. And then they read a book, or they heard a talk, and it's like, oh my God, that's a much cleaner formulation, and I see that, yeah, there's some things I didn't know, and I also see that it can grow a lot more. Because the mindfulness principle is a discovered truth, it's not a revealed truth. So one common thing is that people have sort of discovered it, to some level or other, on their own, and then when they hear somebody give, you know, like Shakespeare says, what oft was a thought but ne'er so well expressed, now suddenly somebody's like really giving voice to this, it's attractive. The other is that they knew somebody that got involved in the practice, they saw them change, they'd known this person maybe for a long time, you know, knew all their stuck places and saw that they were really changing over the years, and they wanted some of that positive change for themselves. So that person who made positive changes in their lives was functioning in a subtle way to teach. And then there is where you're coming from as you're talking to somebody. If you're a meditator, you are either in a meditative state, or at least you have the capacity, if you work at it, to be in a meditative state as you interact with other people. By a meditative state, I mean basically a sense of oneness with them, or a sense of unconditional love. Well people sense that. They sense it through subliminal cues, through body language, through tone of voice, through the way your eyes focus, probably through olfactory cues, smells, where our bodies are constantly subtly communicating with each other. So just being in a meditative state and being around other people, whether they know you meditate or not, whether they think of you as a meditator or not, doesn't make any difference. In fact, one of the most fun aspects of subtle teaching is to go around people that have no connection with spirituality or are maybe actually anti-meditators. They're suspicious of it, or they run their lives on the principles opposite of meditation. To be around people like that and then watch, and they don't know anything about you, you're just another person, and then watch the subtle changes that come about in them just by being around you. Even for short periods of time. That can be very fulfilling for the meditator. Well that's subtle teaching. That's a very important teaching that you're putting out into the world. And then, if at some point they find out why they like being around you, or why things went a little different than they usually go, and they find out, well, you've done meditation, then that's a walking advertisement for it. Any other kind of teaching activity, if you're teaching a class, or if you're guiding people in meditation, you need to have at the core of that, at the center of that, the subtle aspect always going on. Particularly when you interact with people and they ask you questions, and you're taking their questions, and you're responding, that is a place of great exposure, ego exposure, for both the person who asks the question and the person that answers the question. And question and answer, talking back and forth, is the essence of what I call conceptual teaching. You're trying to convey ideas to people. And a person asking a question may have a big ego agenda. The agenda might be to show off, maybe to make you look bad, and therefore make them look good. Or they might have the opposite ego agenda, that they're very insecure. There's really something that they want to know, but they're afraid to ask, because they feel that it may seem like a foolish question, or, you know, that you'll answer in a way that will make them seem foolish. So there's ego involved on the positive or negative side for the person asking. Of course, for the person that has to answer, there's definitely some ego involved. You don't want to look foolish. You don't want to look like, you know, you don't know what you're talking about, etc., etc. Well, this is where the subtle teaching comes in. For you to be able to be in a meditative state and not egoically involved in your answers, to be able to infuse loving-kindness or oneness with the person as you're interacting with them, is on your side. And then you can go further, and if the person has negative ego, by that I mean, negative ego means that they're afraid of looking foolish. You can answer their question in a way that empowers them, so that they feel their question is really welcomed. But if they have positive ego, that they're trying to show off, or, you know, different things, or maybe they don't even know it, but they're just in the habit, some people are just in the habit of being confrontational, or negative, you say, you know, X, they say negative X, you know, you say negative X, they say X, no matter what. Some people are just in the habit of being that way and don't even know it. Those are all, I call that positive ego. You can cancel that out by not getting engaged in it at all. You simply ignore it, okay? Nothing sticks in you, you just ignore it. And you answer them with great kindness and simplicity. And you can just, you can disarm somebody of their positive ego. Not in a way to be competitive with them, but in a way that they're happy to be relieved of that. So all of that is an aspect of subtle teaching. The ability to abide in the place you're talking about, to talk from the place you're talking about, basically, is what it boils down to. All other teaching is predicated upon that. And as I say, this is something that every meditator does. Every meditator is a teacher at the subtle level. So I think that's clear, isn't it? But I'd like to ask if anybody has any questions or comments about that. Just that aspect. When people are really defensive and actually actively trying to prove, you know, in terms of argument that, oh, you know, this is wrong or right or whatever, apart from the, you know, being autonomous with that insight, what outward, you know, behavior can we do? Okay. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. This is very good. Okay. The first is if somebody comes at you with positive ego, our automatic, hard-wired response is to generate another positive ego that conflicts with that. Okay. That's just, you've got to acknowledge that that is hard-wired into the nervous system. And one has to train oneself over a long period of time to dissolve that reaction. What does it mean to dissolve that reaction? Does it mean to dissolve that reaction in yourself? Well, first of all, it certainly does not mean that you suppress that reaction in yourself. So you probably have to go through a long period of time when, whenever you're challenged publicly, you have to be willing to allow a huge subjective reaction of irrational feeling, hostile imagery and negative tapes to arise, okay, over and over and over again. But especially, of course, at the primitive level of the body sensation, because a lot of the intimidation that's done is from our animal wiring, and it's body sensation intimidation. Animals intimidate other animals by, you know, making fear sensations or other kinds of sensations arise in their body. So you have to be willing to allow that to arise and be willing to allow that to arise quite irrationally and intensely. Keeping track of it as you're talking. Now, I know that that's very difficult. That's why I said it's not easy. But you practice up, it's like anything else. Just like you practice your sadhana, your internal skills, you practice these external skills over and over and over again. So the first thing is, you let the reaction, you don't try to suppress or deny how really scared, angry and hurt you feel when somebody, you know, comes at you that way, and you finally get to the point where it pretty much is arising as wave, not particle. So that means that you won't get so caught up in that. If it arises as particle, it's just going to... it's got a gravitational field and it's just going to pull you in, okay? If it arises as wave, it can, you know, sort of pass through. One, that's in terms of your internal, in the moment. The other thing is to be so well prepared with a good answer. Remember that there's two components to that challenge. One component is they actually are asking you a question. The other is their agenda, okay? Well the trick is to have a really good answer to that question as a question, quite independent of the whole agenda that goes with it. So now you've got a good answer because you've honed that answer over years and you've really thought about it, okay, and you're able to allow your talk, image and feel reactions to arise. And then in terms of external behavior, you simply answer the question as though there weren't that whole agenda there at all. You simply ignore that person's ego pressures. And you answer the question with great solicitousness, kindness, gentleness in the voice, like you're really happy to have that question. What are they going to do? This is psychological Aikido. I mean, what are they going to do? Well maybe they come at you with more ego, so you know how it works in Aikido, the more they come at you, the more they're going to fall on the ground. Because it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall, there's nothing they can do. Because you are answering their question kindly. It can't be like forced or with affectation or with a Pollyanna smile, you know. That's why you have to really dissolve, you have to really acknowledge and then really dissolve how hurt, sad and angry that makes anybody feel, okay. So if you've got the answer and it's intellectually well formulated and you're able to let all that stuff come up and dissolve, and then you very kindly answer the question as though they had asked the question kindly, with a kind agenda, then what are they going to do? Do it again? Okay, then they get the same response. Do it again? They get the same response. Well, at some point that ego pressure starts to just dissipate of its own. There's nothing they can do, okay. There's simply, it's what in the business world is called ignoring the objection, except it's a very different thing. This is in sales, some of you may know. There's something called ignoring the objection. You just act as though they hadn't made an objection. It's also related to what's called the assumptive close. These are all business strategies, some of you know it, I mean. Anyway, these are not those, but they're a little bit like that, okay. You're just ignoring the ego, and responding as though it weren't there, and pretty soon that because it's uncomfortable, they just don't want to do it anymore. And besides, they're getting quality answers, which start to become intriguing to them, and then they're distracted from that ego, just like a four-year-old is distracted by a toy. Now they're distracted into, oh, well, that was sort of an interesting answer, you know, et cetera, et cetera. So that's my strategy for dealing with hostile. I actually like having people interview me that are hostile. It's fun. I used to fantasize about, you know, it would be interesting to, like, have Howard Stern interview me or something like that. But then I found out Howard Stern is a meditator. He's actually sympathetic to all of this. He meditates twice a day. You'd never, you know, think so by his public persona, but he says it's, you know, it saved his marriage. It's like, you know, so it's funny. Sometimes you don't know where people are coming from. So that's what I would say about that. So that's when they come at you with positive ego. In ordinary teaching situations where you're responding to people, you more frequently get, let's put it this way, if you're a teacher of some reputation, you much more commonly get people asking you a question from negative ego. By that I mean they'll preface it with, I know this is elementary question or I know this is going to sound stupid, or they think that it might embarrass you and they don't want to ask it, you know, that kind of stuff. So what I always do is I make people feel good for asking questions. But the way that I do that is not phony, okay? It's authentic. Because for me, responding to people's questions and a related thing, responding to their objections is fun. Okay? So now we're moving from the subtle teaching, which I just described, to an aspect of what I call conceptual teaching. This is for me personally. I'm not sure it will be the same for everybody else. But for me personally, the trick is to treat the conveying of conceptual information as a kind of interesting game that you get better and better at as time goes on, and it's a challenge like playing chess, or, I don't know, crossword puzzle, or any other kind of game that you find fun, bridge, something like that. Okay? There's a certain challenge involved, and it's interesting. For example, a person will ask me a question, they'll say, I know this is going to sound silly, but, well, by the time they've got that preamble out of their mouth, I already, I know the kind of question they're going to ask. They think they're going to ask a silly question, okay? I know the general category of question. I don't know the specific question. The general category of question they're going to ask is not what I call a silly question or a simple question, but what I call a basic question. They're going to ask you a basic question, and basic questions are, you have to have honed your answer to every basic question over years and years and years of practice with many, many kinds of people until you can answer all the basic questions in your sleep. When somebody says, you know, this seems like a silly question, but why should I meditate? That's not a silly question, that's a basic question, a question that if you've gone from subtle teaching to conceptual teaching, you need to have an answer to, or maybe a half dozen answers to, for different kinds of people. And how do you hone those answers? Over years of making it fun, getting fun out of the challenge of effective communication. Okay? That's at least the way I go about it. You probably notice that I love having a group of people around me asking me questions, whether they're beginners or people with similar experience or even more experience than me, because it's always a challenge, it's always interesting. How will I answer this kind of person? I might just change one word. Every retreat I change one or two words, but the devil is in the details. Subtle is significant. There's always this, for me, this learning that goes on. So when a person says, this seems like a stupid question, I'll say something like, I'm glad you asked that question. It's not a silly question, that's a basic question, then they feel good for having asked that question. That disabuses them of their negative ego type thing. If somebody asks me a question that I sense it's been hard for them to ask, maybe it's a personal thing to me, or maybe it's, you know, the kind of question like, the things people really want to ask but they don't like, the classic one is, why is it that people that are very developed meditators and famous teachers are so screwed up in certain ways? That's a question a lot of people want to ask, and they usually don't. Well, when somebody asks me, or maybe about me personally, like, oh, I don't know, you talk about that, but is that just something that you believe, or have you actually experienced that? When they ask me a question and I sense that they've had to overcome a little bit of resistance, then I say, this is the kind of question I really like to have, and I really respect you for being willing to ask that question. And I mean it, I'm not just saying that. So that now, once again, they're disabused of their discomfort, you've put them at ease. So what I'm saying is that basically teaching is a kind of kindness, and to convey that to people, you know, is part of at least my style, the way I would like to teach. So in essence, for me, every question is a question I really like to get. Because for me, it's an interesting, challenging game, not in the negative sense of game, but in the sense of play, like a child playing, to see how good I can get this communication thing going. So I would say if you are in a situation to do conceptual teaching, answer people's questions, teach classes, what have you, be it with regard to just your friends or, you know, in a more public thing, you might consider one way to get good at it is to, instead of looking at it as sort of a scary duty, look upon it as a fun game that you're going to get more and more skillful at as time goes on. And I conceive of it like a chess game, but in this case, the enemy that I'm playing chess against is not the person I'm talking with, or even the person who is challenging me, even the person that may violently disagree with me. For example, let's say I'm trying to explain meditation to some sort of religious fanatic of some sort that has a very, you know, fixed idea about things and a lot of ego investment in it. For me, it's like a chess game. But it's not a game of, I'm playing against this person. It's the game that I'm playing against an enemy called breakdown in communication. And the better I can play, the less breakdown in communication there is. If two people can't agree at all on something, well, yeah, I mean, there's right and wrong involved, but basically somebody's not understanding somebody. And actually, both people are probably not understanding in probably a thousand ways. So the enemy in this case that I'm playing against is, what is the structure of the fact that we can't communicate? And over the years, can I get better and better at understanding that structure and hone my communication skills? So that, for me, is the fundamental facet of conceptual teaching, is to relish the challenge of it and to hone it year after year after year after year. Now, that's the general principle. It's like, how do you get good at tennis? Well, you swing and you swing and you swing and you swing. How do you get good at communicating with people? Well, you practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. That's general. Now, I'll give you a few specific little tricks of the trade. One I've already alluded to. Often there's not one answer to a question or one way of explaining something. I try to have a range of answers. If somebody asks me, what is meditation? If they're a Catholic priest, if they're a humanist Marxist, you know, if they're in a certain tradition, if they're a scientist, if they're relatively uneducated, I'll give different answers. But I've honed an answer for each one of those populations and a dozen others over 30 years. So one trick is to remember who you're talking to, and there may be a more effective answer to different populations. A second trick is, which people often forget, is, I don't know is a legitimate answer. When you get in the role of, you're up there teaching, especially when you're publicly teaching. It's really easy to forget this, even though it makes sense. You know, I mean, it's like, yeah, it's trivial, of course. I don't know is a legitimate answer. But once you get the juices going, you're seated in the pontifical throne here, okay? You're speaking ex cathedra from the pontifical, okay? They're all looking to you for the answers, okay? And the juices get flowing, and pretty soon, you discover that without realizing it, you are pontificating. You are giving answers that you sort of think are the answer, that aren't really based on what you know. They're not really based on your experience. Or you're giving an answer that you believe because somebody told you, but you're presenting it as though it were your experience, okay? You're pontificating. And it's so easy to fall into that. So you have to constantly remind yourself. See, there's different gradations of the I don't know. There is the flat I don't know. And then there is the I don't know, but I have a conjecture. And then there is the I don't know, but this is what somebody that I respect has said. These are all versions of the I don't know. And the I don't know is an incredibly powerful thing. First of all, it gets you, it makes things authentic. It gets you out of that pontificating role. It takes pressure off of you to the max, and it makes the people you're teaching feel good, because it's like, oh, okay, you know, that person was honest. It's very disarming that you're willing to do that. So I strongly encourage you to not forget the different sort of permutations of I don't know. And once you realize that, you realize that maybe you can teach more than you would have thought, because maybe half the things that the person asks you, you answer, I don't know. That's okay. If you've given them useful information for the other half, you have absolutely fulfilled a valuable teaching function. So that's one thing to keep in sort of a trick, you know, not a trick, but one of the tricks of the trade to keep in mind, because you can always say I don't know.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0,
